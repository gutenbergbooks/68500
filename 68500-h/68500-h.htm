<p class="p0">UR apology for preparing a bee-book is a very
simple one. We are so frequently applied to
for advice on matters connected with bees and bee-hives,
that it seemed likely to prove a great advantage, alike to
our correspondents and ourselves, if we could point to a
"handy book" of our own, which should contain full
and detailed replies sufficient to meet all ordinary inquiries.
Most of the apiarian manuals possess some
special excellence or other, and we have no wish to
disparage any of them; yet, in all, we have found a
want of explanations relating to several of the more
recent improvements.</p>

<p>It has more especially been our aim to give explicit
and detailed directions on most subjects connected with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ii">- ii -</span>
the hiving and removing of bees, and also, to show
how, by judicious application of the "depriving" system,
the productive powers of the bees may be enormously
increased.</p>

<p>We need say little here as to the interest that attaches
to the apiary as a source of perennial pleasure for the
amateur naturalist. Many of the hives and methods of
management are described with a direct reference to
this class of bee-keepers, so that, besides plain and
simple directions suitable for cottagers with their ordinary
hives, this work will be found to include instructions
useful for the scientific apiarian, or, at least, valuable,
for those who desire to gain a much wider acquaintance
with the secrets of bee-keeping than is now usually possessed.
We would lay stress on the term "acquaintance,"
for there is nothing in the management of the
various bar-and-frame hives which is at all difficult when
frequent practice has rendered the bee-keeper familiar
with them. Such explicit directions are herein given as
to how the right operations may be performed at the
right times, that a novice may at once commence to use
the modern hives. The word "new-fangled" has done
good service for the indolent and prejudiced, but we
trust that our readers will be of a very different class.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iii">- iii -</span>
Let them give a fair trial to the modern appliances for
the humane and depriving system of bee-keeping, and
they will find offered to them an entirely new field of
interest and observation. At present, our continental
neighbours far surpass us as bee-masters; but we trust
that the following season, if the summer be fine, will
prove a turning point in the course of English bee-keeping.
There is little doubt that a greater number of
intelligent and influential persons in this country will
become bee-keepers than has ever been the case before.</p>

<p>Our task would have lost half its interest, did we not
hope that it would result in something beyond the encouragement
of a refined and interesting amusement
for the leisurely classes. The social importance of bee-keeping,
as a source of pecuniary profit for small farmers
and agricultural labourers, has never been appreciated
as it deserves. Yet these persons will not, of themselves,
lay aside the bungling and wasteful plan of
destroying the bees, or learn without being taught the
only proper method, that of deprivation. Their educated
neighbours, when once interested in bee-keeping,
will be the persons to introduce the more profitable
system of humane bee-keeping. The clergy especially,
as permanent residents in the country, may have great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">- iv -</span>
influence in this respect. There is not a rural or
suburban parish in the kingdom in which bee-keeping
might not be largely extended, and the well-being of all
but the very poorest inhabitants would be greatly promoted.
Not only would the general practice of bee-keeping
add largely to the national resources, but that
addition would chiefly fall to the share of those classes
to whom it would be of most value. Moreover, in the
course of thus adding to their income, the uneducated
classes would become interested in an elevating and
instructive pursuit.</p>

<p>It is curious to observe that honey, whether regarded
as a manufactured article or as an agricultural product,
is obtained under economical conditions of exceptional
advantage. If regarded as a manufactured article, we
notice that there is no outlay required for "labour," nor
any expense for "raw material." The industrious
labourers are eager to utilize all their strength: they
never "combine" except for the benefit of their master,
they never "strike" for wages, and they provide their
own subsistence. All that the master-manufacturer of
honey has to do financially is, to make a little outlay
for "fixed capital" in the needful "plant of hives"
and utensils&mdash;no "floating capital" is needed. Then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">- v -</span>
on the other hand, if we regard honey as an agricultural
product, it presents as such a still more striking
contrast to the economists' theory of what are the
"requisites of production." Not only is there no outlay
needed for wages, and none for raw material, but
there is nothing to be paid for "use of a natural
agent." Every square yard of land in the United
Kingdom may come to be cultivated, as in China,
but no proprietor will ever be able to claim "rent"
for those "waste products" of the flowers and leaves
which none but the winged workers of the hive can
ever utilize.</p>

<p>The recent domestication in England of the Ligurian
or "Italian Alp" bee adds a new and additional source
of interest to bee-culture. We have, therefore, gone
pretty fully into this part of the subject; and believe that
what is here published with regard to their introduction
embodies the most recent and reliable information
respecting them that is possessed by English apiarians.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Some of our apiarian friends may be inclined to be discouraged
from cultivating the Ligurian bees in consequence of
the liability to their becoming hybridised when located in proximity
to the black bees. We can dispel these fears by stating
that we have not unfrequently found that hybrid queens possess
the surprising fecundity of the genuine Italian ones, whilst the
English stocks in course of time become strengthened by the
infusion of foreign blood.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">- vi -</span></p>

<p>We are under many obligations for the advice and
assistance that we have on many occasions received
from Mr. T. W. Woodbury, of Exeter, whose apiarian
skill is unrivalled in this country. Our acknowledgments
are also due to Mr. Henry Taylor, author of an
excellent "Bee-keeper's Manual," for his help and
counsel during the earlier years of our apiarian experience.
Both the before-mentioned gentlemen have frequently
communicated to us their contrivances and
suggestions, without thought of fee or reward for them.
In common with most recent writers on bee-culture, we
are necessarily largely indebted to the standard works
of Huber and succeeding apiarians. From the more
recent volume of the Rev. L. L. Langstroth we have
also obtained useful information. But having ourselves,
of later years, had considerable experience in the manipulation
and practical management of bees, we are
enabled to confirm or qualify the statement of others, as
well as to summarize information gleaned from many
various sources.</p>

<p>Let it be understood, that we have no <i>patented devices</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">- vii -</span>
to push: we are free to choose out of the many apiarian
contrivances that have been offered of late years, and
we feel perfectly at liberty to praise or blame as our
experience warrants us in doing. It does not follow
that we necessarily disparage hives which are not
described herein; we have sought, as much as possible,
to indicate the <i>principles</i> on which <i>good hives</i> must be
constructed, whatever their outward size or shape. All
through the work, we have endeavoured to adopt the
golden rule of "submission to Nature" by reference
to which all the fancied difficulties of bee-keeping may
be easily overcome. In none of the attempts of men
to hold sway over natural objects is the truth of Bacon's
leading doctrine more beautifully illustrated than in
the power that the apiarian exercises in the little world
of bees.</p>

<p>Some persons may consider we have used too many
poetical quotations in a book dealing wholly with matters
of fact. We trust, however, that the examination of the
extracts will at once remove that feeling of objection.</p>

<p>We venture to hope that the following pages contain
many valuable hints and interesting statements which
may tend to excite increased and renewed attention to
the most useful and industrious of all insects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">- viii -</span></p>

<p>Although bees have neither reason nor religion for
their guide, yet from them man may learn many a
lesson of virtue and industry, and may even draw from
them thoughts suggestive of trust and faith in God.</p>

<p>We beg leave to conclude our preface, and introduce
the subject, by the following extract from Shakspeare,
who, without doubt, kept bees in that garden at Stratford
wherein he used to meditate:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p0">HERE are two classes of persons for whom
bee-culture should have a strong interest, and
two distinct purposes for which the pursuit may be
followed. First, there is the cottager or small farmer,
who, in thousands of instances, might add considerably
to his income by bee-keeping; and, secondly, there is the
man of "retired leisure" and refinement, who, in the
personal tendance of an apiary, would find an easy and
interesting occupation, and one which could not fail to
quicken his faculties of general scientific observation.
Moreover, in contemplating the wonderful skill, industry,
and prevision of his insect-artisans, the bee-keeper would
find in his apiary constant illustrations of creative
wisdom.</p>

<p>Amongst the humbler classes in the rural districts, the
neglect of bee-keeping is to be attributed to an exaggerated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">- 2 -</span>
idea of the trouble needful for the care of a few
hives, and also to ignorance of the easier and more
profitable methods of modern management. Many of
the wealthier country or suburban residents, also, are
averse to the personal trouble which they fancy needful
in keeping an apiary; and, perhaps, some gentlemen
are more afraid than they would like to own of that very
efficient weapon of defence with which the honey bee is
provided. But the prejudices against bees are quite unnecessary;
bees are as tractable as they are intelligent,
and it is the purpose of this little book to show that bee-culture
is an easy and safe, as well as a deeply interesting,
pursuit. Possibly, also, some who do us the favour
to read our detailed explanations will see how the rural
clergyman, or the benevolent landlord, who keeps an
apiary of his own, may be of signal service to his poorer
neighbours in explaining to them the mysteries of bee-keeping.</p>

<p class="p0">VERY hive or bee colony comprises in summer
three distinct classes of bees, each class having
functions peculiar to itself, and which are essential to
the well-being of the whole community. As each bee
knows its own proper duties, they all work harmoniously
and zealously together, for the common weal. Certain
apparent exceptions to the good-fellowship of the bees
will be hereafter noticed, but those arise out of essential
conditions in the social economy of the bee community.
That <i>honey bees</i> should live in society, as they do in hives,
is absolutely needful. A bee, in an isolated condition, is
a very helpless, delicate little creature, soon susceptible
of cold, and paralysed thereby, unless able to join her
companions before night comes on. By congregating
in large numbers, bees maintain warmth, whatever the
external temperature may be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">- 4 -</span></p>

<p>The three classes of bees are:&mdash;the queen-bee, with
the pup&aelig; or embryos intended for queens; the working
bees; and the drones, or male bees.</p>


<h3 id="THE_QUEEN">THE QUEEN.</h3>

<p>Appropriately styled, by German bee-keepers, the
mother-bee, is the only perfectly developed female
among the whole population of each separate colony.
Thus her majesty indisputably sways her sceptre by a
divine right, because she lives and reigns in the hearts
of loving children and subjects.</p>

<p>Dr. Evans<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> introduces the queen-bee to our notice
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"First of the throng, and foremost of the whole.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">One 'stands confest the sovereign and the soul.'"</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> Dr. Evans&mdash;who may be styled the poet-laureate of the bees&mdash;lived
at Shrewsbury, where he practised as a physician. His
poem on bees is written with great taste and careful elaboration,
and it describes the habits of bees with a degree of accuracy only
attainable after continuous scientific observation.</p>

</div>

<p>The queen may very readily be distinguished from the
rest of the bees by the greater length of her body and
the comparative shortness of her wings; her legs are
longer, and are not furnished with either brushes or
baskets as those of the working bee, for, being constantly
fed by the latter, she does not need those implements;
the upper surface of her body is of a brighter black than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">- 5 -</span>
the other bees, whilst her colour underneath is a yellowish
brown;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> her wings, which do not extend more than
half the length of her body, are sinewy and strong; her
long abdomen tapers nearly to a point; her head is
rounder, her tongue more slender, and not nearly so
long, as that of the working bee, and her sting is
curved. Her movements are measured and majestic; as
she moves in the hive the other bees form a circle round
her, none venturing to turn their backs upon her, but all
anxious to show that respect and attention due to her
rank and station. Whenever, in the exercise of her
sovereign will, the queen wishes to travel amongst her
subjects, she experiences no inconvenience from overcrowding;
although the part of the hive to which she is
journeying may be the most populous, way is immediately
made, the common bees tumbling over each other to get
out of her path, so great is their anxiety not to interfere
with the royal progress.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> Yellow Italian queens form an exception in point of colour.
See frontispiece, fig. I.</p>

</div>

<p>It is the chief function of the queen to lay the eggs from
which all future bees originate, the multiplication of the
species being the purpose of her existence; and she follows
it up with an assiduity similar to that with which the
workers construct combs or collect honey. A queen is
estimated to lay in the breeding season from 1,500 to
2,000 eggs a-day, and in the course of one year is
supposed to produce more than 100,000 bees. This is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">- 6 -</span>
indeed a vast number; but when there is taken into consideration
the great number required for swarms, the
constant lessening of their strength by death in various
ways, and the many casualties attending them in their
distant travels in search of the luscious store, it does not
seem that the case is over-stated.</p>

<p>In a Glass Unicomb Hive,&mdash;which we shall hereinafter
describe,&mdash;all the movements of the queen-bee may be
traced; she may be seen thrusting her head into a cell
to discover whether it be occupied with an egg or honey,
and if empty, she turns round in a dignified manner and
inserts her long body&mdash;so long, that she is able to deposit
the egg at the bottom of the cell; she then passes on to
another, and so continues industriously multiplying her
laborious subjects. It not unfrequently happens when
the queen is prolific, and if it be an early season, that
many eggs are wasted for want of unoccupied cells; for
in that case the queen leaves them exposed at the
bottom of the hive, when they are greedily devoured by
the bees.</p>

<p>The queen-bee, unlike the great majority of her
subjects, is a stayer at home; generally speaking, she
only quits the hive twice in her life. . The first occasion
is on the all-important day of her marriage, which
always takes place at a great height in the air, and
generally on the second or third day of her princess-life;
she never afterwards leaves the hive, except to lead off
an emigrating swarm. Evans, with proper loyalty, has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">- 7 -</span>
duly furnished a glowing epithalamium for the queen-bee
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"When noon-tide Sirius glares on high,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Young love ascends the glowing sky,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">From vein to vein swift shoots prolific fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And thrills each insect fibre with desire;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Then Nature, to fulfil thy prime decree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Wheels round, in wanton rings, the courtier Bee;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Now shyly distant, now with bolder air,</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">Through fields of ether, veiled in vap'ry gloom</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">They seek, with amorous haste, the nuptial room;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">As erst the immortal pair, on Ida's height,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Wreath'd round their noon of joy ambrosial night."</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The loyalty and attachment of bees to their queen is
one of their most remarkable characteristics; they constantly
supply her with food, and fawn upon and caress
her, softly touching her with their antenn&aelig;&mdash;a favour
which she occasionally returns. When she moves about
the hive, all the bees through whom she successively
passes pay her the same homage; those whom she
leaves behind in her track close together, and resume
their accustomed occupations.</p>

<p>The majestic deportment of the queen-bee and the
homage paid to her is, with a little poetic licence, thus
described by Evans:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"But mark, of royal port and awful mien,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Where moves with measured pace the insect Queen!</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Twelve chosen guards, with slow and solemn gait,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Bend at her nod, and round her person wait."</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">- 8 -</span></p>
<p>This homage is, however, only paid to matron queens.
Whilst they continue princesses, they receive no distinctive
marks of respect. Dr. Dunbar, the noted Scotch apiarian,
observed a very striking instance of this whilst experimenting
on the combative qualities of the queen-bee
"So long," says he, "as the queen which survived the
rencontre with her rival remained a virgin, not the
slightest degree of respect or attention was paid her;
not a single bee gave her food; she was obliged, as
often as she required it, to help herself; and in crossing
the honey cells for that purpose, she had to scramble,
often with difficulty, over the crowd, not an individual of
which got out of her way, or seemed to care whether she
fed or starved: but no sooner did she become a mother,
than the scene was changed, and all testified towards her
that most affectionate attention, which is uniformly exhibited
to fertile queens."</p>

<p>The queen-bee, though provided with a sting, never
uses it on any account, except in combat with her sister-queens.
But she admits of no rival to her throne; almost
her first act, on coming forth from the cell, is an attempt
to tear open and destroy the cells containing the pup&aelig;
of princesses likely to become competitors. Should it so
happen that another queen of similar age does exist in
the hive at the same time, the two are speedily brought
into contact with each other, in order to fight it out and
decide by a struggle, mortal to one of them, which is to
be the ruler;&mdash;the stronger of course is victorious, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">- 9 -</span>
remains supreme. This, it must be admitted, is a wiser
method of settling the affair than it would be to range
the whole hive under two distinct banners, and so create
a civil war, in which the members of the rival bands
would kill and destroy each other for matters they individually
have little or no concern about: for the bees care
not which queen it is, so long as they are certain of having
one to rule over them and perpetuate the community.</p>

<p>After perusing the description given above of the
attachment of bees to their queen, it may be easy to
imagine the consternation a hive is thrown into when
deprived of her presence. The bees first make a diligent
search for their monarch in the hive, and then
afterwards rush forth in immense numbers to seek her.
When such a commotion is observed in an apiary, the
experienced bee-master will repair the loss by giving a
queen: the bees have generally their own remedy for
such a calamity, in their power of raising a new queen
from amongst their larv&aelig;; but if neither of these means
be available, the whole colony dwindles and dies. The
following is the method by which working bees provide
a successor to the throne when deprived of their queen
by accident, or in anticipation of the first swarm, which
is always led by the old queen:&mdash;</p>

<p>They select, when not more than three days old, an egg
or grub previously intended for a worker-bee, and then
enlarge the cell so selected by destroying the surrounding
partitions; they thus form a royal cradle, in shape
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">- 10 -</span>
very much like an acorn cup inverted. The chosen
embryo is then fed liberally with a peculiar description
of nurture, called by naturalists "royal jelly"&mdash;a pungent
food, prepared by the working bees exclusively for
those of the larvae that are destined to become candidates
for the honour of royalty. Should a queen be forcibly
separated from her subjects, she resents the interference,
refuses food, pines, and dies.</p>

<p>The whole natural history of the queen-bee is in itself
a subject that will well repay for continuous study. Those
who desire to follow it, we would refer to the complete
works of <span class="smcap">Huber</span>&mdash;the greatest of apiarians,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Swammerdam</span>,
<span class="smcap">Bevan</span>, <span class="smcap">Langstroth</span>, &amp;c. The observations upon
the queen-bee needful to verify the above-mentioned
facts can only be made in hives constructed for the purpose,
of which the "Unicomb Observatory Hive" is the
best. In ordinary hives the queen is scarcely ever to be
seen; where there are several rows of comb, she invariably
keeps between them, both for warmth and to be
more secure from danger. The writer has frequently
observed in stocks which have unfortunately died, that
the queen was one of the last to expire; and she is
always more difficult to gain possession of than other
bees, being by instinct taught that she is indispensable to
the welfare of her subjects.</p>

<p>The queen enjoys a far longer life than any of her
subjects, her age generally extending to four, or even
five years. The drones, which are mostly hatched in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">- 11 -</span>
early spring, seldom live more than three or four months,
even if they should escape the sting of the executioner,
to which they generally fall victims. The worker-bee, it
is now a well-ascertained fact, lives from six to eight
months, in no case exceeding the latter; so that we may
reckon that the bees hatched in April and May expire
about the end of the year; and it is those of the autumn
who carry on the duties of the hive until the spring and
summer, that being the time when the greatest number
of eggs are laid. The population of a hive is very small
during the winter, in comparison with the vast numbers
gathering produce in the summer,&mdash;produce which they
themselves live to enjoy but for a short period. So that
not only, as of old, may lessons of industry be learned
from bees, but they also teach self-denial to mankind,
since they labour for the community rather than for themselves.
Evans, in describing the age of bees, thus paraphrases
the well known couplet of Homer, in allusion
to the fleeting generations of men:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"Like leaves on trees the race of bees is found.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Now green in youth, now withering on the ground;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Another race the spring or fall supplies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">They droop successive, and successive rise."</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<h3 id="THE_DRONE">THE DRONE.</h3>

<p>The drones are male bees; they possess no sting, are
more hairy and larger than the common bee, and may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">- 12 -</span>
be easily distinguished by their heavy motion, thick-set
form, and louder humming. Evans thus describes
the drones:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">"Their short proboscis sips</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No luscious nectar from the wild thyme's lips;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From the lime leaf no amber drops they steal,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor bear their grooveless thighs the foodful meal:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On others' toils, in pampered leisure, thrive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The lazy fathers of the industrious hive;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet oft, we're told, these seeming idlers share</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The pleasing duties of parental care;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With fond attention guard each genial cell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And watch the embryo bursting from the shell."</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But Dr. Evans had been "told" what was not correct
when he sought to dignify drones with the office of
"nursing fathers,"&mdash;that task is undertaken by the
younger of the working bees. No occupation falls to
the lot of the drones in gathering honey, nor have they
the means provided them by Nature for assisting in the
labours of the hive. The drones are the progenitors of
working bees, and nothing more; so far as is known,
that is the only purpose of their short existence.</p>

<p>In a well-populated hive the number of drones is computed
at from one to two thousand. "Naturalists," says
Huber, "have been extremely embarrassed to account
for the number of males in most hives, and which seem
only a burden to the community, since they appear to
fulfil no function. But we now begin to discern the object
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">- 13 -</span>
of Nature in multiplying them to such an extent. As
fecundation cannot be accomplished within the hive, and
as the queen is obliged to traverse the expanse of the
atmosphere, it is requisite that the males should be
numerous, that she may have the chance of meeting
some one of them in her flight. Were only two or three
in each hive, there would be little probability of their
departure at the same instant with the queen, or that
they would meet her in their excursions; and most of the
females might thus remain sterile." It is important for
the safety of the queen-bee that her stay in the air should
be as brief as possible: her large size and slowness
of flight render her an easy prey to birds. It is not
now thought that the queen always pairs with a drone
of the <i>same</i> hive, as Huber seems to have supposed. The
drone that happens to be the selected husband is by no
means so fortunate as at first sight may appear, for it is
a law of nature that the bridegroom does not survive
the wedding-day. Her majesty, although thus left, a
widowed, is by no means a sorrowful, bride, for she soon
becomes the happy mother of a large family. It cannot
be said that she pays no respect to the memory of
her departed lord, for she never marries again. Once
impregnated,&mdash;as is the case with most insects,&mdash;the
queen-bee continues productive during the remainder of
her existence. It has, however, been found that though
old queens cease to lay worker eggs, they may continue
to lay those of drones. The swarming season being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">- 14 -</span>
over,&mdash;that is about the end of July,&mdash;a general massacre
of the "lazy fathers" takes place. Dr. Bevan, in the
"Honey Bee," observes on this point: "The work of the
drones being now completed, they are regarded as useless
consumers of the fruits of others' labour; love is at
once converted into hate, and a general proscription
takes place. The unfortunate victims evidently perceive
their danger, for they are never at this time
seen resting in one place, but darting in and out of the
hive with the utmost precipitation, as if in fear of being
seized."</p>

<p>Their destruction is thought, by some, to be caused by
their being harassed until they quit the hive; but Huber
says he ascertained that the death of the drones was
caused by the stings of the workers. Supposing the
drones come forth in May, which is the average period
of their being hatched, their destruction takes place
somewhere about the commencement of August, so that
three months is the usual extent of their existence; but
should it so happen that the usual development of the
queen has been retarded, or that the hive has by chance
been deprived of her, the massacre of the drones is
deferred. In any case, the natural term of the life of
drone-bees does not exceed four months, so that they are
all dead before the winter, and are not allowed to be
useless consumers of the general store.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">- 15 -</span></p>


<h3 id="THE_WORKER_BEE">THE WORKER-BEE.</h3>

<p>The working bees form, by far, the most numerous
class of the three kinds contained in the hive, and least
of all require description. They are the smallest of the
bees, are dark brown in colour, or nearly black,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and
much more active on the wing than are either drones or
queens. The usual number in a healthy hive varies from
twelve to thirty thousand; and, previous to swarming,
exceeds the larger number. The worker-bee is of
the same sex as the queen, but is only partially developed.
Any egg of a worker-bee&mdash;by the cell being
enlarged, as already described, and the "royal jelly"
being supplied to the larva&mdash;may be hatched into a
mature and perfect queen. This, one of the most
curious facts connected with the natural history of bees,
may be verified in any apiary by most interesting experiments,
which may be turned to important use. With
regard to the supposed distinctions between "nursing"
and working bees, it is now agreed that it only consists
in a division of labour, the young workers staying at
home to feed the larv&aelig; until they are themselves vigorous
enough to range the fields in quest of supplies. But, for
many details of unfailing interest, we must again refer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">- 16 -</span>
our readers to the standard works on bees that have
already been named.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> Italian workers form an exception in point of colour. See
<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I., fig. 2</a>.</p>

</div>


<h3 id="EGGS">THE EGGS OF BEES.</h3>

<p>It is necessary that some explanation should be given
as to the existence of the bee before it emerges from the
cell.</p>

<p>The eggs (<a href="#Plate_II">Plate II., fig. 7</a>) of all the three kinds of
bees, when first deposited, are of an oval shape, and of
a pearly-white colour. In four or five days the egg
changes to a worm, and in this stage is known by the
names of larva or grub (<a href="#Plate_II">Plate II., fig. 8</a>), in which state
it remains four to six days more. During this period it
is fed by the nurse-bees with a mixture of farina and
honey, a constant supply of which is given to it. The
next transformation is to the nymph or pupa form. The
nurse-bees now seal up the cells with a preparation
similar to wax, and then the pupa spins round itself a
film or cocoon, just as a silkworm does in its chrysalis
state. The microscope shows that this cradle-curtain is
perforated with very minute holes, through which the
baby-bee is duly supplied with air. No further attention
on the part of the bees is now requisite, except a proper
degree of heat, which they take care to keep up&mdash;a
position for the breeding cells being selected in the
centre of the hive, where the temperature is likely to be
most congenial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">- 17 -</span></p>

<p>Twenty-one days after the egg is first laid (unless
cold weather should have retarded it) the bee quits
the pupa state, and, nibbling its way through the waxen
covering that has enclosed it, comes forth a winged
insect. The eggs of drones require twenty-four days,
and those of queens sixteen days, to arrive at maturity,
and are hatched in warm summer weather, a higher
temperature being necessary. In the Unicomb Observatory
Hives, the young bees may distinctly be seen as
they literally fight their way into the world, for the other
bees do not take the slightest notice, nor afford them any
assistance. We have frequently been amused in watching
the eager little new-comer, now obtruding its head,
and anon compelled to withdraw into the cell to escape
being trampled on by the apparently unfeeling throng,
until at last it has succeeded in making its exit. The
little grey creature, after brushing and shaking itself,
enters upon its duties in the hive, such as the nursing
before alluded to, or secreting wax, and in (say) a
week issues forth to the more laborious occupation of
gathering honey in the fields&mdash;thus early illustrating
that character for industry which has been proverbial at
least since the days of Aristotle, and which has in our
day been rendered familiar even to infant minds through
the nursery rhymes of Dr. Watts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">- 18 -</span></p>


<h3 id="INCREASE_IN_BEES">INCREASE OF BEES.</h3>

<p>Every one is familiar with the natural process of
"swarming," by which bees provide themselves with
fresh space, and seek to plant colonies to absorb their
increase of population. But the object of the bee-master
is to train and educate his bees, and in so
doing he avoids much of the risk and trouble which is
incurred by allowing the busy folk to follow their own
devices. The various methods for this end adopted by
apiarians all come under the term of the "depriving"
system, and they form part of the great object of humane
and economical bee-keeping, which is to save the bees
alive instead of slaughtering them, as under the old
clumsy system. A very natural question is often asked:&mdash;How
is it that, upon the depriving system, where our
object is to prevent swarming, the increase of numbers
is not so great as upon the old plan? It will be seen
that the laying of eggs is performed by the queen only,
and that there is but one queen to each hive; so that
where swarming is prevented, there remains only one
hive or stock, as the superfluous princesses are not allowed
to come to maturity. If all those princesses were to
become monarchs, or mother-bees, and to emigrate with
a proportionate number of workers, increase would be
going on more rapidly; but the old stock would be so
impoverished thereby as possibly to yield no surplus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">- 19 -</span>
honey, whilst the swarms might come off too late for
them to collect sufficient store whereon to grow populous
enough to withstand the winter.</p>

<p>With bees, as with men, "union is strength;" and it
is often better to induce them to remain as one family,
rather than to part numbers at a late period of the
honey-gathering season, without a prospect of supporting
themselves, and so perish from cold and hunger
during the ordeal of the winter season. Would it not
in such cases have been better for the little folk, to have
kept under one roof through the winter, and to have
been able to take full advantage of the following early
spring? This is one of the great secrets of successful
bee-keeping.</p>

<p>Our plan of giving additional store-room will, generally
speaking, prevent swarming. This stay-at-home
policy, we contend, is an advantage; for instead of the
loss of time consequent upon a swarm hanging out preparatory
to flight, all the bees are engaged in collecting
honey, and that at a time when the weather is most
favourable and the food most abundant. Upon the old
system, the swarm leaves the hive simply because the
dwelling has not been enlarged at the time when the
bees are increasing. The emigrants are always led off
by the old queen, leaving either young or embryo queens
to lead off after-swarms, and to furnish a mistress for
the old stock, and carry on the multiplication of the
species. Upon the antiquated and inhuman plan, where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">- 20 -</span>
so great a destruction takes place by the brimstone
match, breeding must, of course, be allowed to go on to
its full extent to make up for such sacrifices. Our chief
object under the new system' is to obtain honey free from
all extraneous matter. Pure honey cannot be gathered
from combs where storing and breeding are performed
in the same compartment. For fuller explanations
on this point, we refer to the various descriptions
of our improved hives in a subsequent section of this
work.</p>

<p>There can now be scarcely two opinions as to the uselessness
of the rustic plan of immolating the poor bees
after they have striven through the summer so to "improve
each shining hour." The ancients in Greece and
Italy took the surplus honey and spared the bees, and
now for every intelligent bee-keeper there are ample
appliances wherewith to attain the same results. Mr.
Langstroth quotes from the German the following
epitaph, which, he says, "might be properly placed
over every pit of brimstoned bees":&mdash;</p>

<h3 id="SWARMING">SWARMING.</h3>

<p>The spring is the best period at which to commence
an apiary, and swarming-time is a good starting-point
for the new bee-keeper. The period known as the
swarming season is during the months of May and June.
With a very forward stock, and in exceedingly fine
weather, bees do occasionally swarm in April. The
earlier the swarm, the greater is its value. If bees
swarm in July, they seldom gather sufficient to sustain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">- 22 -</span>
themselves through the winter, though by careful feeding
they may easily be kept alive, if hived early in the
month.</p>

<p>The cause of a swarm leaving the stock-hive is, that
the population has grown too large for it. Swarming is
a provision of Nature for remedying the inconvenience of
overcrowding, and is the method whereby the bees seek
for space in which to increase their stores. By putting
on "super-hives," the required relief may, in many
cases, be given to them; but should the multiplication of
stocks be desired, the bee-keeper will defer increasing
the space until the swarm has issued forth. In May,
when the spring has been fine, the queen-bee is very
active in laying eggs, and the increase in a strong,
healthy hive is so prodigious that emigration is necessary,
or the bees would cease to work.</p>

<p>It is now a well-established fact that the old queen
goes forth with the first swarm, preparation having been
made to supply her place as soon as the bees determine
upon the necessity of a division of their commonwealth.
Thus the sovereignty of the old hive, after the first
swarm has issued, devolves upon a young queen.</p>

<p>As soon as the swarm builds combs in its new abode,
the emigrant-queen, being impregnated and her ovaries
full, begins laying eggs in the cells, and thereby speedily
multiplies the labourers of the new colony. Although
there is now amongst apiarians no doubt that the old
queen quits her home, there is no rule as to the composition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">- 23 -</span>
of the swarm: old and young alike depart. Some
show unmistakable signs of age by their ragged wings,
others their extreme youth by their lighter colour; how
they determine which shall stay and which shall go has
not yet been ascertained. In preparation for flight, bees
commence filling their honey bags, taking sufficient, it is
said, for three days' sustenance. This store is needful,
not only for food, but to enable the bees to commence
the secretion of wax and the building of combs in their
new domicile.</p>

<p>On the day of emigration, the weather must be fine,
warm, and clear, with but little wind stirring; for the
old queen, like a prudent matron, will not venture out
unless the day is in every way favourable. Whilst her
majesty hesitates, either for the reasons we have mentioned,
or because the internal arrangements are not
sufficiently matured, the bees will often fly about or hang
in clusters at the entrance of the hive for two or three
days and nights together, all labour meanwhile being
suspended. The agitation of the little folk is well described
by Evans:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"See where, with hurried step, the impassioned throng</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Pace o'er the hive, and seem, with plaintive song,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">T' invite the loitering queen; now range the floor,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And hang in cluster'd columns from the door;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Or now in restless rings around they fly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Nor spoil thy sip, nor load the hollowed thigh;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">E'en the dull drone his wonted ease gives o'er,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Flaps his unwieldy wings, and longs to soar."</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">- 24 -</span></p>

<p class="p0">But when all is ready, a scene of the most violent agitation
takes place; the bees rush out in vast numbers,
forming quite a dark cloud as they traverse the air.</p>

<p>The time selected for the departure of the emigrants
is generally between 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> and 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>; most swarms
come off within an hour of noon. It is a very general
remark that bees choose a Sunday for swarming, and
probably this is because then greater stillness reigns
around. It will not be difficult to imagine that the careful
bee-keeper is anxious to keep a strict watch, lest he
should lose such a treasure when once it takes wing.
The exciting scene at a bee-swarming has been well
described by the apiarian laureate:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">"Up mounts the chief, and, to the cheated eye,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In many country districts it is a time-honoured custom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">- 25 -</span>
for the good folks of the village to commence on such
occasions a terrible noise of tanging and ringing with
frying-pan and key. This is done with the absurd notion
that the bees are charmed with the clangorous din,
and may by it be induced to settle as near as possible to
the source of such sweet sounds. This is, however, quite
a mistake: there are other and better means for the
purpose. The practice of ringing was originally adopted
for a different and far more sensible object&mdash;viz., for the
purpose of giving notice that a swarm had issued forth,
and that the owner was anxious to claim the right of
following, even though it should alight on a neighbour's
premises. It would be curious to trace how this ancient
ceremony has thus got corrupted from the original
design.</p>

<p>In case the bees do not speedily after swarming manifest
signs of settling, a few handfuls of sand or loose
mould may be thrown up in the air so as to fall among
the winged throng; they mistake this for rain, and then
very quickly determine upon settling. Some persons
squirt a little water from a garden engine in' order to
produce the same effect.</p>

<p>There are, indeed, many ingenious devices used by
apiarians for decoying the swarms. Mr. Langstroth
mentions a plan of stringing dead bees together, and
tying a bunch of them on any shrub or low tree upon
which it is desirable that they should alight; another
plan is, to hang some black woven material near the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">- 26 -</span>
hives, so that the swarming bees may be led to suppose
they see another colony, to which they will hasten to
attach themselves. Swarms have a great affinity for
each other when they are adrift in the air; but, of
course, when the union has been effected, the rival
queens have to do battle for supremacy. A more ingenious
device than any of the above is by means of a
mirror, to flash a reflection of the sun's rays amongst a
swarm, which bewilders the bees, and checks their flight.
It is manifestly often desirable to use some of these endeavours
to induce early settlement, and to prevent, if
possible, the bees from clustering in high trees or under
the eaves of houses, where it may be difficult to hive
them.</p>

<p>Should prompt measures not be taken to hive the bees
as soon as the cluster is well formed, there is danger of
their starting on a second flight; and this is what the
apiarian has so much to dread. If the bees set off a
second time, it is generally for a long flight, often for
miles, so that in such a case it is usually impossible to
follow them, and consequently a valuable colony may be
irretrievably lost.</p>

<p>Too much care cannot be exercised to prevent the
sun's rays falling on a swarm when it has once settled.
If exposed to heat in this way, bees are very likely to
decamp. We have frequently stretched matting or
sheeting on poles, so as to intercept the glare, and thus
render their temporary position cool and comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">- 27 -</span></p>

<p>Two swarms sometimes depart at the same time, and
join together; in such a case, we recommend that they
be treated as one, by putting them into a hive as before
described, taking care to give abundant room and not
to delay affording access to the super hive or glasses.
They will settle their own notions of sovereignty by one
queen destroying the other. There are means of separating
two swarms, if done at the time; but the operation
is a formidable one, and does not always repay
even those most accustomed to such manipulation.</p>

<p>With regard to preparations for taking a swarm, our
advice to the bee-keeper must be the reverse of Mrs.
Glass's notable injunction as to the cooking of a hare.
Some time before you expect to take a swarm, be sure
to have a suitable hive in which to take it, and also every
other requisite properly ready. Here we will explain
what was said in the introduction as to the safety of
moving and handling bees. A bee-veil or dress will
preserve the most sensitive from the possibility of being
stung. This article, which may be bought with the
hives, is made of net close enough to exclude bees, but
open enough for the operator's vision. It is made to go
over the hat of a lady or cap of a gentleman; it closes
round the waist, and has sleeves fastening at the
wrist. A pair of photographer's india-rubber gloves
completes the full dress of the apiarian, who is then invulnerable,
even to enraged bees. But bees when
swarming are in an eminently peaceful frame of mind;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">- 28 -</span>
having dined sumptuously, they require to be positively
provoked before they will sting. Yet there may be one
or two foolish bees who, having neglected to fill their
honey bags, are inclined to vent their ill-humour on the
kind apiarian. When all is ready, the new hive is held
or placed in an inverted position under the cluster of
bees, which the operator detaches from their perch with
one or two quick shakes; the floor-board is then placed
on the hive, which is then slowly turned up on to its base,
and it is well to leave it a short time in the same place,
in order to allow of stragglers joining their companions.</p>

<p>If the new swarm is intended for transportation to a
distance, it is as well for it to be left at the same spot
until evening, provided the sun is shaded from it: but if
the hive is meant to stand in or near the same garden,
it is better to remove it within half an hour to its permanent
position, because so eager are newly-swarmed
bees for pushing forward the work of furnishing their
empty house, that they sally forth at once in search of
materials.</p>

<p>A swarm of bees, in their natural state, contains from
10,000 to 20,000 insects, whilst in an established hive
of Italian bees they number 40,000 and upwards. Five
thousand bees are said to weigh one pound; a good
swarm will weigh from three to five pounds. We have
known swarms not heavier than 2&frac12; pounds that were in
very excellent condition in August as regards store for
the winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">- 29 -</span></p>

<p>Hitherto, all our remarks have had reference to first
or "prime" swarms; these are the best, and when a
swarm is purchased, such should be bargained for.</p>

<p>Second swarms, known amongst cottage bee-keepers
as "casts," usually issue from the hive nine or ten days
after the first has departed. It is not always that a
second swarm issues, so much depends on the strength
of the stock, the weather, and other causes; but should
the bees determine to throw out another, the first hatched
queen in the stock-hive is prevented by her subjects from
destroying the other royal princesses, as she would do if
left to her own devices. The consequence is that, like
some people who cannot have their own way, she is
highly indignant; and, when thwarted in her purpose,
utters, in quick succession, shrill, angry sounds, much
resembling "<i>Peep, peep</i>," commonly called "piping,"
but which more courtly apiarians have styled the <i>vox
regalis</i>.</p>

<p>This royal wailing continues during the evening, and
is sometimes so loud as to be distinctly audible many
yards from the hive. When this is the case, a swarm
may be expected either on the next day, or at latest
within three days. The second swarm is not quite so
chary of weather as the first; it was the <i>old</i> lady who
exercised so much caution, disliking to leave home except
in the best of summer weather.</p>

<p>In some instances, owing to favourable breeding seasons
and prolific queens, a third swarm issues from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">- 30 -</span>
hive; this is termed a "colt:" and, in remarkable instances,
even a fourth, which in rustic phrase is designated
a "filly." A swarm from a swarm is called a
"maiden" swarm, and, according to bee theory, will
again have the old queen for its leader.</p>

<p>The bee-master should endeavour to prevent his
labourers from swarming more than once; his policy is
rather to encourage the industrious gathering of honey,
by keeping a good supply of "supers" on the hives.
Sometimes, however, he may err in putting on the
supers too early or unduly late, and the bees will then
swarm a second time, instead of making use of the store-rooms
thus provided. In such a case, the clever apiarian,
having spread the swarm on the ground, will select the
queen, and cause the bees to go back to the hive from
whence they came. This operation requires an amount
of apiarian skill which, though it may easily be attained,
is greater than is usually possessed.</p>

<p class="p0">LTHOUGH the principal object in compiling the
present work has been the endeavour to induct
our readers into the way of keeping bees according to
the most recent and approved methods, it requires but
little apology for thus apparently deviating from our
prescribed course, by devoting a small portion of our
space to a description of the anatomy of the wonderful
little creatures whose labours all our contrivances are
intended to assist, and since it will at once be admitted
that a knowledge of their habits is not only interesting to
the bee-keeper, but enables him to conduct his apiary in
accordance therewith.</p>

<p>Of the insect tribe, the bee is certainly the most distinguished;
with the exception of the silkworm, none can
approach her in ministering to the wants, or rather to
the luxuries, of the human family. The instinct bees
possess for feeding on flowers, bringing home honey and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">- 32 -</span>
pollen, and secreting wax, entitles them to our close consideration
of their structure and of the tools provided
them by Nature for carrying on their handiwork.</p>

<p>In a treatise of this kind, intended to be of a popular
character, we shall endeavour to place these details
before our readers in a concise and simple manner,
avoiding as much as may be technical terms, and referring
those who wish to go more deeply into this branch
of the subject to the works of Bonnet, Huber, Kirby
and Spence, Dr. Bevan, &amp;c. .</p>

<p>In the course of our description, we shall frequently
have to refer to the steel engravings, Plates I. and II.,
drawn by Mr. E. W. Robinson, artist to the Entomological
Society of London, who has most carefully dissected
bees we sent him for the purpose, subjected these
dissections to the microscope, and skilfully produced the
accompanying illustrations, which will so much assist us
in our agreeable task. These delineations are so clear,
that a little explanation will suffice to bring home to the
understanding of the curious the component parts of the
bee, and the uses to which the various members are
applied.</p>

<p>Because the bee is so small an insect, its organization
ought not to be neglected to be investigated. "The
bee is little among such as fly, but her fruit is the chief
of sweet things." The enlightened Boyle, when contemplating
the wonders of Nature, declared that his astonishment
had been more excited by the mite than by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">- 33 -</span>
elephant; and that his admiration dwelt "not so much
on the <i>clocks</i> as on the <i>watches</i> of creation."<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> Dr. Bevan.</p>

</div>

<p>The figures 1, 2, and 3, <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>., in the frontispiece,
respectively represent the exterior forms of the queen,
the worker, and the drone. They are thus coloured to
illustrate the Yellow Italian Alp, or Ligurian bee, now
deservedly held in such high estimation by bee-keepers,
and of whose good qualities we shall, in a
subsequent section of this work, have occasion more
fully to treat. All the bees constituting a stock may not
be of quite so bright a colour as those represented: the
old bees differ in appearance from the younger ones;&mdash;darkened
bodies and ragged wings, not grey hairs and
wrinkled faces, are the signs of old age; so that with bees
(especially Ligurians), as with the gentler sex of the human
race, there is appointed a period both of youth and beauty.</p>

<p>The anatomical structure of our English bee is much
the same as that of the Italian;<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> a description of the one
will therefore serve for the other. The most apparent
difference consists in the colour. The English bee is of a
blackish brown; both varieties have their bodies wholly
covered with close-set hairs. These hairs deserve particular
attention, because, although so small, each hair is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">- 34 -</span>
<i>feather-shaped</i>, consisting of a stem and branches somewhat
analogous to the feathers of birds. This form is
extremely serviceable to the insect, when revelling in the
corolla of flowers, to collect the farina, and, besides thus
useful, is peculiarly adapted for retaining animal heat.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> Naturalists consider the Italian bee a very superior race,
and that the various organs are stronger and of greater capacity;
it is, however, not easy to define the precise anatomical
superiority.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> "Naturalist's Library."</p>

</div>

<p id="HEAD">The insect is divided into three parts&mdash;the <i>head</i>, the
<i>thorax</i> or <i>chest</i>, and the <i>abdomen</i>.</p>

<p>The head of the queen (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I., fig. 1 <i>c</i></a>), as also that
of the drone (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I., fig. 3 <i>c</i></a>), is rounder than that of
the worker-bee. The latter (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I, fig. 2 <i>c</i></a>) is of a
triangular shape, and much flattened, as in <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.,
fig. 2* <i>c</i></a>, which shows the side view. In common with
other creatures, the head contains the inlet for nutrition,
and is the seat of the principal organs of sensation.</p>

<p>In the figures before alluded to may be seen the
double visual apparatus with which bees are provided.
The oval divisions on each side of the head are the two
eyes, the secondary organs of vision being the three small
eyes on the top of the head, called the <i>ocelli</i>. We shall
first describe the two larger eyes, which, as seems to be
the case with all insects, are immovable, and have neither
irides nor pupils, nor eyelids to cover them, but are protected
from the dust or pollen of flowers by a number of
small hairs, as well as by a horny tunicle, which defends
and secures them from injury. The multitude of hexagonal
lenses which compose the eye of a bee make it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">- 35 -</span>
appear, when viewed through a microscope, exactly like
honey-comb.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> A German writer computes that in each
eye there are 3,500 lenses. In <a href="#Plate_II">Plate II., fig. 5</a> represents
three of these hexagonal prisms or lenses, magnified.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> Dr. Bevan.</p>

</div>

<p>The construction of the eye for seeing objects best at
a moderate distance will account for the fact that
bees mount high up into the air after collecting their
store of food, and then, having determined the point,
no matter how far off, they fly homewards with the
directness of a cannon ball, and alight at the door
of their own habitation, though the country around may
be crowded with hives: but on reaching the entrance,
their vision appears defective, for they then feel their
way with the antenn&aelig; as if totally blind; and should
the hive have been moved a little, they will rise again
into the air to obtain a more distant view, suited to the
lengthened focus of their sight.</p>

<p>When a stock or swarm is brought from a distance,
bees do not take their departure at once, but reconnoitre
awhile, visiting surrounding objects so as to well know
the spot again, in order to return thereto.</p>

<p>The precise purpose or use of the three small eyes
does not appear to be exactly known, except that they
are intended to heighten the general sense of seeing
which the creature so peculiarly requires. Some naturalists
suggest that they are to give a defensive vision
upwards from the cups of flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">- 36 -</span></p>

<p>The mouth of the bee is a most complex structure,
marvellously adapted for its duties, and consists of the
mandibles, the ligula, or tongue, also called the proboscis,
and other less important parts. The mandibles
are the two sides of the upper jaw. <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I., fig. 1 <i>d</i></a>,
shows the mandible of the queen, which, similar to that
of the drone (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I., fig. 3 <i>d</i></a>), is provided with two
teeth, whilst the mandible of the worker (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I., fig. 2 <i>d</i></a>)
is without teeth. The latter having to manipulate the
wax with smoothness, the teeth would doubtless be
objectionable. These mandibles are strong, horny, and
sharp-pointed, to assist in breaking down food between
them, and, in other respects, constitute serviceable tools
with which to seize their enemies, destroy the drones, &amp;c.
The tongue (<a href="#Plate_II">Plate II., fig. 3</a>), or proboscis, is a long,
slender projection, flattish in form, and about the thickness
of a bristle. It has about forty cartilaginous rings,
each of which is fringed with minute hairs, having also
a small tuft of hair at its extremity, where it is somewhat
serrated. The tongue acts by rolling about, sweeping
or lapping up, by means of the fringes around it, everything
to which it is applied; thus, when a bee alights
upon a flower, it pierces the petals and stamina, where
the nectar is secreted, deposits its collection on the
tongue, which, when withdrawn into the mouth, propels
the gathered material into the gullet (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I., fig. 2 <i>c</i></a>) at
its base, and from thence passes into the various internal
organs, to which reference will be made hereafter. At
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">- 37 -</span>
times, in building combs, the tongue is used as a trowel,
with which the minute scales of wax are deposited in
their appropriate places, and the desired finish is given
to the cells. This organ was formerly described by
naturalists as a hollow tube, but we now know, by dissection,
that this is not the case, but that it acts as a
brush, and, by a peculiar muscular contraction externally,
draws the liquid into the mouth. Thus, when a bee is
imbibing food, the rings of the abdomen have a vibratory
motion similar to pumping, showing to the casual observer
that suction is rapidly going on in some form or other.</p>

<p>The labial palpi (<a href="#Plate_II">Plate II., fig. 3 <i>o</i></a>) rise from the base
of each side of this lapping instrument, and are also
ciliated exteriorly; outside these are the lower jaws,
or maxill&aelig; (<a href="#Plate_II">Plate II., fig. 2 <i>n</i></a>), similarly provided with
hairs. When the jaws (<a href="#Plate_II">Plate II., fig. 3 <i>n</i> and <i>o</i></a>) close
on the tongue, they form a sheath or defence thereto.</p>

<p>With the mandibles of the upper jaw opening right and
left, and the maxill&aelig; or lower jaws, which serve to hold
the object laboured upon, the insect prepares its work
for the sweeping-up apparatus of the lower parts. Thus,
when combs become mouldy, or in any way unfit receptacles
for brood or honey, these tools provided by Nature
serve the place of hands, and the bees are able to chop
up in small pieces, and remove from their dwelling, whatever
lumber of this kind may be offensive to them. The
whole of this apparatus, while perfect in action in an
expanded state, can be folded or coiled together when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">- 38 -</span>
not in use, so as to form one strong and well-protected
instrument.</p>

<p>The antenn&aelig; (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I., figs. 1<i>a</i>, 2<i>a</i>, 3<i>a</i></a>,) are most
important instruments, and are planted between or below
the eyes and a little below the ocelli, one on either side:
they consist of a number of tubular joints, each having a
separate motion; being thus jointed throughout their
whole length, they are, therefore, capable of every
variety of flexure, and their extremities are exquisitely
sensitive. With the antenn&aelig;, these insects recognise
their queen, and appear to communicate to each other
their joys and sorrows. For instance, if a colony be deprived
of its queen, bees may be seen rushing about the
hive, and, with a nervous twinge, crossing their antenn&aelig;
and conveying the intelligence of their forlorn state.
The sense of touch is here most acute. Huber points
out a moonlight night as the best time for observing the
antenn&aelig; in this respect. The bees guarding against
the intrusion of moths, and not having light enough to
see fully, circumambulate their doors like vigilant sentinels,
with the antenn&aelig; stretched right before them; and
woe to the moth that comes within reach&mdash;the instant it
is felt, its death follows. The sense of hearing has been
denied bees, whilst others contend that these organs are
situate in their antenn&aelig;. The sounds which bees emit,
particularly at swarming time, are conclusive that they
possess this faculty; the only reason for arriving at an
opposite conclusion seems to be, that no precise organ of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">- 39 -</span>
hearing can be found. Naturalists are now more united
in the opinion that the seat of hearing is here located.
The antenn&aelig; are said to have also another office, viz.,
that they act as a barometer, by which bees know the
state of the weather and are premonished of storms; so
that this pair of horns play an important part, since such
useful faculties are thus combined. In the dark recesses
of the hive the antennas are exceedingly serviceable, and
may truly be denominated "eyes to the blind." Bees
possess acutely the senses of taste and smell. In consequence
of their being detected occasionally lapping the
impure liquids from stable or other f&#339;tid drains, Huber
considered the former the least perfect of their senses.
It is now ascertained that bees, like most animals, are
fond of salt; and in spring, more especially, their instinct
teaches them that salt is beneficial for their health after
their winter confinement, and they therefore resort to
dunghills and Stagnant marshes, from which they are,
doubtless, able to extract saline draughts.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied, however, that, according to our
ideas, bees' taste is otherwise at fault; it sometimes
happens that, where onions and leeks abound and are
allowed to run to seed, bees are so anxious to
complete their winter stores, that, from feeding on
these plants, a disagreeable flavour is communicated to
the honey. Again, the fact, well known in history, related
by Xenophon in the retreat of the Ten Thousand,
that bees in Asia Minor extracted honey from plants which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">- 40 -</span>
had not only a disagreeable but a poisonous tendency to
man, shows that it is quite possible, where such poisonous
plants abound, for the bees to extract the juices without
any injury to themselves.</p>

<p>The sense of smell, so largely possessed by bees, is
extremely serviceable to them. Attracted by the fragrance
of flowers, bees may be seen winging their way
a considerable distance in an undeviating course, even
sometimes in the face of weather which one might have
thought they would not have braved.</p>

<p id="THORAX">The thorax or chest approaches in figure to a sphere,
and is united to the head by a thread-like ligament.
This is the centre of the organs of motion. Here are
attached both the muscles that move the legs and wings,
and the legs and wings themselves.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Plate_II">Plate II., fig. 1</a>, <i>b, b, b</i>, show the muscles that move
the wings; <i>e, e</i>, the bases of the wings.</p>

<p>The wings consist of two pairs of unequal size, which
are hooked to one another. In <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I., fig. <span class="allsmcap">A</span></a>, will be seen
the margins of the two wings. In fig. <span class="allsmcap">B</span> are the eighteen
or twenty hooks placed on the anterior margin of
the hinder wing, whilst the posterior margin of the
fore wing is beautifully folded over to receive them,
so that, when distended for flying, the two wings on
each side act as one to steady their movements in
flight.</p>

<p>The bee has six legs, three on either side. Each
leg is composed of several joints, having articulations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">- 41 -</span>
like a man's arm, for the thigh, the leg, and the foot.
The foremost pair of these are the shortest; with them
the bee unloads the little pellets from the baskets on her
thighs: the middle pair are somewhat longer, and the
hindmost the longest of all. On the outside of the
middle joint of these last there is, in each leg, a small
cavity, in the form of a marrow spoon, called the
"pollen basket." In <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I., fig. 2 <i>b</i></a> shows the inner
side of the hind leg and pollen brush; 2 <i>b*</i>, same figure,
the outer side and pollen basket.</p>

<p>The legs are covered with hairs, more particularly
the edges of the cavity mentioned, in which the kneaded
pollen requires to be maintained securely. In this they
convey those loads of pollen which are so constantly
seen carried into a hive.</p>

<p>This basket, or pollen groove, in the thigh is peculiar
to the worker; neither queen nor drone have anything
of the kind.</p>

<p>Another provision of the bee's limbs consists in a
pair of hooks attached to each foot, with their points
opposite to each other, by means of which the bees
suspend themselves from the roof or sides of hives, and
cling to each other as they do at swarming time or
prior to and during the formation of new comb, thus
forming a living curtain. In these circumstances, each
bee, with its two fore claws, takes hold of the two
hinder legs of the one next above it.</p>

<p>This mode of suspension is, no doubt, agreeable to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">- 42 -</span>
them, although the uppermost bees appear to be
dragged by the weight of the whole. Wildman supposed
that bees had a power of distending themselves
with air, to acquire buoyancy, and thus lessen the
burden of the topmost bees. They find no difficulty
in extricating themselves from the mass; the most
central of the group can make its way without endangering
the stability of the grape-like cluster.</p>

<p>Bees are able to walk freely in an inverted position,
either on glass or other slippery substances. The
peculiar mechanism of their feet, which enables them
to do so, consists in their having in the middle of
each hook a thin membranous little cup or sucker
that is alternately exhausted and filled with air. Flies
have the same beautiful apparatus&mdash;hence a fly commonly
selects the ceiling for a resting-place. These
little air-cups, or exhausted receivers, may be seen
by applying a strong magnifying-glass to a window
that has a bee traversing the reverse side. The
edges of these little suckers are serrated, so as to close
against any kind of surface to which their legs may be
applied. This apparatus may be also serviceable for
gathering the pollen before transmitting it to the baskets
on the hind legs. Besides these appendages and apparatus
of the thorax, that region is traversed by the
&#339;sophagus or gullet (the opening to which will be
found in <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I, fig. 2 <i>c</i></a>), on its way to the digestive
and other organs, situate in the third part of the insect&mdash;viz.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">- 43 -</span>
the abdomen. The covering of the thorax, with
the external covering of the gullet, may be seen in the
drawing of the magnified dissected body of the bee
(<a href="#Plate_II">Plate II., fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p>The breathing apparatus of bees is a very remarkable
feature: they have no lungs, but, instead, air-vessels
or tubes, ramifying through every part of the frame.
These openings, called "spiracles," are found in the
sides of their bodies, behind the wings. Two of the
openings are located in the thorax, and one on each
side of the scales of the abdomen.</p>

<p>These air-vessels would be difficult to show in a drawing,
the multitude of hairs which protect them are in the
way of getting at a very distinct delineation. The writer
has traced their oval form by the aid of Messrs. Smith
and Beck's "Binocular Microscope," and exceedingly
interesting objects they appeared. From the circumstance
of bees breathing through these orifices in their
bodies, it will not be difficult to understand how sadly the
little creatures must be inconvenienced when, by accident,
they fall on loose mould, and thus have their breathing
pores choked with dust: it also shows how needful it is
to prevent bees being besmeared with honey (by using
bad appliances for feeding), which is still more injurious
to them. These air-vessels are the only real circulating
system, as bees have neither lungs, heart, liver,
nor blood. It appears, however, that a white fluid matter,
called "chyle," which, in degree, answers the purpose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">- 44 -</span>
of blood, is produced in the intestines, nourishes the
body, receives the oxygen from the air-vessels, and generates
that animal warmth so necessary for the insect's
well-being. Bees have the power of counteracting superabundant
heat by perspiration. Not unfrequently, on a
hot summer's morning, a good deal of moisture may be
noticed at the entrance of a crowded hive, which the
inmates have been enabled to throw off. This is a healthy
sign, because a sign of great numerical strength.</p>

<p id="ABDOMEN">The abdomen, attached to the posterior part of the
thorax by a slender ligament, has, for an outer covering,
six folds or scales of unequal breadth, overlapping each
other, and contains the honey-bag, or first stomach, the
ventricle, or true stomach (<a href="#Plate_II">Plate II., figs. 1 and 2<i>f</i></a>), with
other intestines, to be hereafter referred to.</p>

<p>The honey-bag (<a href="#Plate_II">Plate II., figs. 1 and 2, <i>d</i></a>) is an
enlargement of the gullet, and, although called the first
stomach, no digestion takes place here. In shape it is
like a taper oil flask; when full, it is about the size of a
small pea, and so transparent that the colour of the honey
may be seen through it. This sac, as it is sometimes
called, is susceptible of contraction, and so organized as
to enable the bee to disgorge a part of its contents at
pleasure, to fill the honey-cells of the hive. It has formed
a subject of some controversy whether any or what
change takes place in the nectar of flowers whilst in the
bee's stomach.</p>

<p>A short passage (<a href="#Plate_II">Plate II., figs. 1 and 2, <i>f</i></a>) leads to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">- 45 -</span>
ventricle or true stomach, which is somewhat larger. This
receives the food from the honey-bag, for the nourishment
of the bee and the secretion of wax. The stomach,
like the honey-bag, has a considerable number of muscles,
which are brought into play to help the digestive and
other organs. The biliary vessels (<a href="#Plate_II">Plate II., figs. 1 and
2, <i>h, h</i></a>) receive the chyle from the digested food in the
stomach, which from thence is conveyed to all parts of
the body for its support.</p>

<p>Formerly, naturalists thought that wax was elaborated
from pollen; but it is now fully known that it is the animal
fat of the bees, and to produce it requires a considerable
consumption of honey to supply the drain upon
the system. Whilst this secretion is going on, bees keep
themselves very still. In order to pass through the pores
of the abdomen, the wax is, no doubt, a liquid oily matter,
which, on making its appearance outside the abdominal
rings, thickens, and exudes from under the four medial
rings, in flakes like fish scales, one on either side; so that
there are eight of these secreting cavities, which are
peculiar to the worker: they are not found either in the
queen or drone. The shape of these cavities is that of
an irregular pentagon, and the plates of wax, being
moulded in them, exhibit accordingly the same form
(see <a href="#Plate_II">Plate II., fig. 5, <i>w</i></a>).</p>

<p>No direct channel of communication between the
stomach and these receptacles, or wax-pockets, has yet
been discovered; but Huber conjectures that the secreting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">- 46 -</span>
vessels are contained in the membrane which lines
these receptacles, and which is covered with a reticulation
of hexagonal meshes, analogous to the inner coat of
the second stomach of ruminant quadrupeds.</p>

<p>The little plates of wax are withdrawn by the bee itself,
with its hind feet, carried to the mouth with its fore feet,
where the wax is made soft and ductile. When a cluster
or swarm is placed in a new hive, and the bees suspend
themselves in the form of a garland, as before described,
it seems feasible that the lower bees pass their secretions
up the living ladder to the uppermost ones, to be moulded
by them into those beautiful white hexagonal shapes of
which new comb is composed. The rapidity with which
comb-building progresses at such times would lead to
the supposition that there is a division of labour of this
kind among them, just as our labourers convey building
material to the artisan on the scaffold above. This
work of comb-building is carried forward in warm
weather; a cold temperature interferes with the secretion
of wax.</p>

<p>The last important organ of the abdomen is the sting:
this small but effective weapon is situate close to the
stomach, and is found in the queen and worker, but is
absent in the drone. Our engraving (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate 11., fig. 4</a>)
exhibits the sting of the worker-bee, with its muscles and
attachments: <i>r</i> shows the muscles that move the sting,
and <i>q</i> the curved base of the sheath that encloses the
sting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">- 47 -</span></p>

<p>Much beautiful mechanism is observed on a microscopic
examination of this weapon and its appendages, so
powerful in comparison with their bulk. The sting is
composed of three separate portions, <i>i. e.</i>, two sheaths
(as seen in <a href="#Plate_II">Plate II., fig. 4</a>) and the barb. The sheaths,
which are attached to the powerful muscles on either
side at <i>s</i>, are first protruded in the act of stinging, and,
clasping the barb, enables the insect to bury it in the flesh
to the depth of one-twelfth of an inch; at the same time,
by a muscular contraction, the poison is forced along the
groove, and the barb enters the wound, causing the
well-known painful effects which arise from the sting of
a bee.</p>

<p>The darts composing this instrument are furnished
with teeth or barbs, set obliquely on their outer side,
which give it the appearance of an arrow, and by which
it is retained in the wound until the poison has been
ejected.</p>

<p>If the sufferer could only command himself so as to
remain perfectly passive, the bee might be able to draw
in these barbs which protrude beyond the sheath, and
would then have a chance of withdrawing the sting: the
little insect would consequently inflict less pain, and
might perhaps escape paying the penalty of her life.
It generally happens, however, that the excitement of
both parties is so great, that the poor bee leaves behind
the whole apparatus, and even part of her intestines,
so that her death is the result, and the wound is more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">- 48 -</span>
severe. The sting is about the sixth part of an inch
long, and is largest at the base. Here are situated the
glands or ducts (<a href="#Plate_II">Plate II., fig. 4, <i>u</i></a>). By these the poison
is secreted, and passed into the poison-bag (<a href="#Plate_II">Plate II.,
fig. 4, <i>f</i></a>), which acts as a reservoir for retaining it till
required.</p>

<p>On the subject of the sting, Paley remarks:&mdash;"The
action of the sting affords a beautiful example of the
union of chemistry and mechanism: of chemistry, in
respect to the venom, which in so small a quantity can
produce such powerful effects; of mechanism, as the
sting is not a simple, but a compound instrument. The
machinery would have been comparatively useless had it
not been for the chemical process, by which, in the
insect's body, honey is converted into poison; and, on
the other hand, the poison would have been ineffectual
without an instrument to wound, and a syringe to inject
the fluid."</p>

<p>As before stated, the drone has no sting, but, in place
thereof, the organs of reproduction. And now, in concluding
this section, we would remark the wonderful
mechanism and finish all the works of the Great Master
Builder unfold. In the works of man we see, perhaps, a
piece of mechanism of unquestioned beauty and excellence;
but there is a bolt here or screw there that might
have been dispensed with, and does not possess any definite
use, whilst in the works of Nature everything has a
place; we may not at once comprehend the exact
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">- 49 -</span>
purpose of some intricate parts, but that only implies
that we have not made a thorough investigation. The
most minute hair serves its required end. "Canst thou
by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the
Almighty unto perfection?"</p>

<h3>NUTT'S COLLATERAL HIVE.</h3>

<div class="textleft" style="width: 53px;">
  <img src="images/letter_t.png" width="53" height="53" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="p0">HE late Mr. Nutt, author of "Humanity to
Honey Bees," may be regarded as a pioneer of
modern apiarians; we therefore select his hive wherewith
to begin a description of those we have confidence
in recommending. Besides, an account of Mr. Nutt's
hive will necessarily include references to the various
principles which subsequent inventors have kept in
view.</p>

<p>Nutt's Collateral Hive consists of three boxes placed
side by side (<span class="allsmcap">C, A, C</span>), with an octagonal box b on the top,
which covers a bell-glass. Each of the three boxes is
nine inches high, nine inches wide, and eleven inches
from back to front. Thin wooden partitions, in which
six or seven openings corresponding with each other are
made, divide these compartments, so that free access
from one box to the other is afforded to the bees; this
communication is stopped, when necessary, by a zinc
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">- 51 -</span>
slide passing down between each box. The octagonal
cover B is about ten inches in diameter and twenty high,
including the sloping octagonal roof, surmounted with
an acorn as a finish. There are two large windows in
each of the end boxes, and one in the centre box.
Across the latter is a thermometer, scaled and marked
so as to be an easy guide to the bee-master, showing
him, by the rise in temperature, the increased accommodation
required; this thermometer is a fixture, the indicating
part being protected by two pieces of glass, to
prevent the bees from coming between it and the window,
and thereby obstructing the view.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="page51" style="width: 320px;">
  <img src="images/page51.png" width="320" height="325" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">D D</span> are ventilators. In the centre of each of the end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">- 52 -</span>
boxes is a double zinc tube, reaching down a little below
the middle: the outer tube is a casing of plain zinc, with
holes, about a quarter of an inch wide, dispersed over it;
the inside one is of perforated zinc, with' openings so
small as to prevent the escape of the bees; a flange or
rim keeps the tubes suspended through a hole made to
receive it. The object in having double tubing is to
allow the inner one to be drawn up, and the perforations
to be opened by pricking out the wax, or rather the
propolis, with which bees close all openings in their
hives. These tubes admit a thermometer, enclosed in a
cylindrical glass, to be occasionally inserted during the
gathering season; it requires to be left in the tube for
about a quarter of an hour, and on its withdrawal, if
found indicating ninety degrees or more, ventilation
must be adopted to lower the temperature. The ornamental
zinc top D must be left raised, and is easily kept
in that position by putting the perforated part a little on
one side.</p>

<p>The boxes before described are placed on a raised
double floor-board, extending the whole length&mdash;viz.,
about thirty-six inches. The floor-board projects a few
inches in front. In the centre is the entrance (as our
engraving only shows the back of the hive, we must
imagine it on the other side); it is made by cutting a
sunken way, of about half an inch deep and three inches
wide, in the floor-board, communicating only with the
middle box; it is through this entrance alone that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">- 53 -</span>
bees find their way into the hive, access to the end boxes
and the super being obtained from the inside. An
alighting-board is fitted close under the entrance, for
the bees to settle upon when returning laden with homey.
This alighting-board is removable for the convenience of
packing. The centre, or stock-box <span class="allsmcap">A</span>, called by Mr.
Nutt the <i>Pavilion of Nature</i>, is the receptacle for the
swarm. For stocking this, it will be necessary to tack
the side tins so as to close the side openings in the
partition, and to tack some perforated zinc over the
holes at top; the swarm may then be hived into it just
the same as with a common hive. A temporary bottom
board may be used if the box has to be sent any distance,
or a cloth may be tied round to close the bottom (the
latter plan is best, because allowing plenty of air); and
when brought home at night, the bees being clustered
at the top, the cloth or temporary bottom must be removed,
the box gently placed on its own floor-board, and
the hive set in the place it is permanently to occupy.
<span class="allsmcap">E E</span> are two block fronts, which open with a hinge. A
semicircular hole, three inches long and two inches wide
in the middle, is cut in the upper bottom-board, immediately
under the window of each box; these apertures
are closed by separate perforated zinc slides. These
blocks, when opened, afford a ready means of reducing
the temperature of the side boxes, a current of air being
quickly obtained, and are also useful for allowing the
bees to throw out any refuse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">- 54 -</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="page54" style="width: 149px;">
  <img src="images/page54.png" width="149" height="89" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The centre <span class="allsmcap">F</span> is a drawer, in which is a feeding-trough,
so constructed that the bees
can descend through the opening
before mentioned on to a false
bottom of perforated zinc. Liquid
food is easily poured in by pulling
out the drawer a little way; the bees readily
come down on to the perforated zinc, and take the food
by inserting their probosces through the perforations,
with no danger of being drowned. Care must be exercised
that the food is not given in such quantity as to
come above the holes; by this means; each hive has a
supply of food accessible only to the inmates, with no
possibility, when closely shut in, of attracting robber-bees
from other hives.</p>

<p>The exterior of these hives is well painted with two
coats of lead colour, covered with two coats of green,
and varnished. Notwithstanding this preservation, it is
absolutely essential to place such a hive under a shed
or cover of some sort, as the action of the sun and rain
is likely to decay the wood, whilst the extreme heat of
a summer sun might cause the combs to fall from their
foundations.</p>

<p>Neat and tasteful sheds may be erected, either of zinc
supported by iron or wooden rods, or a thatched roof
may be sustained in the same manner, and will form a
pretty addition to the flower-garden.</p>

<p>When erecting a covering, it will be well to make it a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">- 55 -</span>
foot or two longer, so as to allow of a cottage hive on
either side, as the appearance of the whole is much improved
by such an arrangement.</p>

<p>The following directions, with some adaptation, are
from "Nutt on Honey-Bees":&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the middle box the bees are to be first placed: in
it they should first construct their beautiful combs, and
under the government of one sovereign, the mother of
the hive, carry on their curious work, and display their
astonishing architectural ingenuity. In this box, the
regina of the colony, surrounded by her industrious,
happy, humming subjects, carries on the propagation of
her species, deposits in the cells prepared for the purpose
by the other bees thousands of eggs, though she
seldom deposits more than one egg in a cell at a time:
these eggs are nursed up into a numerous progeny by
the other inhabitants of the hive. It is at this time, when
hundreds of young bees are daily coming into existence,
that the collateral boxes are of the utmost importance, both
to the bees domiciled in them and to their proprietors;
for when the brood become perfect bees in a common
cottager's hive, a swarm is the necessary consequence.
The queen, accompanied by a vast number of her subjects,
leaves the colony, and seeks some other place in
which to carry on the work Nature has assigned her.
But as swarming may, by proper precaution and attention
to this mode of management, generally be prevented,
it is good practice to do so, because the time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">- 56 -</span>
necessarily required to establish a new colony, even supposing
the cottager succeeds in saving the swarm,
would otherwise be employed in collecting honey, and in
enriching the old hive. Here, then, is one of the features
of this plan&mdash;viz., <i>the prevention of swarming</i>. The period
when symptoms of swarming begin to present themselves
may be known by an unusual noise, the appearance
of more than common activity among the bees in
the middle box, and, above all, by a sudden rise of temperature,
which will be indicated by the quicksilver in
the thermometer rising to seventy-five degrees, as scaled
on the thermometer in the box; when these symptoms
are apparent, the bee-master may conclude that additional
space is required. The top sliding tin should now
be withdrawn from under the bell-glass, which will open
to the bees a new store-room; this they will soon occupy,
and fill with combs and honey of pure whiteness, if the
weather be favourable for their uninterrupted labour. It
may be well here to mention, that if the glass have a small
piece of clean worker comb attached to the perforated
ventilating tube, the bees will more speedily commence
their operations in it. When the glass is nearly filled,
which in a good season will be in a very short space of
time, the bees will again require increased accommodation;
this will also be indicated by the thermometer
further rising to eighty-five degrees. The end box, as
thereon marked, must now be given them. Previously to
drawing up a slide to enlarge their crowded house, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">- 57 -</span>
manager should carefully take off the empty end box he
intends to open to them, and thoroughly cleanse it, and
then smear or dress the inside of it with a little liquid
honey. Thus prepared, he must return the box to its
proper situation, and then withdraw the sliding tin that
hitherto has cut it off from the middle box; by so doing,
the store-room is again enlarged. The bees will commence
operations in this new apartment. This simple
operation, performed at the proper time, generally prevents
swarming; by it the queen gains a vast addition to
her dominions, and, consequently, increasing space for the
multiplying population of her domicile. Provided the
weather continue fine, and the thermometer has risen to
ninety-five degrees, as marked on the scale, the remaining
tin may be also withdrawn, thereby giving the bees
admittance to another box. There is now no lack of
store-rooms or of employment for our indefatigable
labourers. The cylinder thermometer is required to be
occasionally dropped into the ventilating tube of the side
boxes to ascertain their temperature; for, if exceeding
or approaching that of the middle box, it must be
reduced by ventilating: this is done by raising the zinc
tops, to allow the air to pass through the perforations.
The grand object of this system is to keep the end boxes
and the bell-glass cooler than the pavilion or middle
box, so as to induce the queen to propagate her species
there and there only, and not in the depriving part of
the hive; by this means the side and upper combs are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">- 58 -</span>
in no way discoloured by brood. The queen requires a
considerable degree of warmth; the middle box does
not require more ventilation than the additional openings
afford. The bees enjoy coolness in the side boxes, and
thereby the whiteness and purity of the luscious store are
increased."</p>

<p>After the foregoing directions for the working of the
hive, it remains to be told how to obtain possession of
the store, and to get rid of our industrious tenants from
the super and end boxes, of which the super glass will
be almost sure to be filled first, having been first given to
them. The operation of taking honey is best performed
in the middle of a fine sunny day. The mode we prefer
is as follows:&mdash;Pass an ordinary table-knife all round
underneath the rim of the glass, to loosen the cement,
properly called propolis; then take a piece of fine wire,
or a piece of string will do, and, having hold of the two
ends, draw it under the glass very slowly, so as to allow
the bees to get out of the way. Having brought the
string through, the glass is now separated from the hive;
but it is as well to leave the glass in its place for an hour
or so; the commotion of the bees will then have subsided:
and another advantage we find is, that the bees suck up
the liquid and seal up the cells broken by the cutting off.
You can then pass underneath the glass two pieces of
tin or zinc; the one may be the proper slide to prevent
the inmates of the hive coming out at the apertures, the
other tin keeps all the bees in the glass close prisoners.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">- 59 -</span>
After having confined the bees in the glass for a short
time, you must see whether they manifest symptoms of
uneasiness, because, if they do not, it may be concluded
that the queen is among them. In such a case, replace
the glass, and recommence the operation on a future
day. It is not often that her majesty is in the depriving
hive or glass; but this circumstance does sometimes
happen, and the removal at such a time must be avoided.
When the bees that are prisoners run about in great
confusion and restlessness, the operator may conclude
that the queen is absent, and that all is right. The
glass may be taken away a little distance off, and placed
in a flower-pot or other receptacle, where it will be
safe when inverted and the tin taken away: the bees
will then be glad to make their escape back to their
hive. A little tapping at the sides of the glass will
render their tarriance uncomfortable, and the glass may
then be taken into a darkened room or out-house, with
only a small aperture admitting light, which must be
open; the bees, like all insects, make towards the light,
and so escape. The bee-master should brush them off
with a feather from the comb as they can be reached;
but on no account, if there are many bees, should the
glass be left, because the bees that are in the glass will
gorge themselves to their full, and speedily bring a host
of others from the adjacent hives, who, in a very little
time, would leave only the empty combs. It is truly
marvellous how soon they will carry all the store back
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">- 60 -</span>
again, if allowed to do so. An empty glass should be
put on to the hive in place of the full one, as it will
attract the bees up, thereby preventing the too close
crowding of the hive; and, if the summer be not too far
advanced, they will work more honey-comb in it.</p>

<p>The removal of the end boxes is a somewhat similar
process, but they should on no account be taken away,
at the same time as the glass, or, indeed, at a time
when any other hive is being&mdash;<i>robbed</i> we were going to
say, for it is robbery to the bees: they intended the
honey for their winter food, and are much enraged at
being deprived of it. First shut down the dividing tin;
the bees in the end box are now prisoners separated
from the hive; keep them so half an hour, and then take
away the box bodily to another part of the garden, or
into the dark out-house, as before recommended.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place here to say something
respecting the enthusiastic inventor of the collateral
hive&mdash;Thomas Nutt&mdash;who was an inhabitant of Spalding,
in Lincolnshire. Having been disabled during a considerable
period by rheumatic fever, he devoted all his
attention to bees, at a time when bee-culture was but
little valued; and, although it must be admitted that two
boxes were used side by side long before Mr. Nutt's
day, still it is due to him to state that the adoption
of three boxes was entirely his own idea, and that,
so far as he then knew, the collateral system was
his original invention. His statements have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">- 61 -</span>
severely criticised, and it does appear almost incredible
that the weight of honey which he names could have
been produced in one season. But as in the district
where he lived there is grown an immense quantity
of mustard seed&mdash;the flowers of which afford excellent
forage for bees&mdash;the honey harvests there would,
doubtless, be very large. If Mr. Nutt has given his little
favourites too much praise, it will be only charitable now
to account for his statements by an excess of zeal and
enthusiasm in this his study of bee-culture. It may be
that the golden harvests he spoke and wrote of have
been so far useful that they have induced many to commence
bee-keeping, some of whom, whilst they condemned
his statements, have themselves written really
useful and practical works on the subject, which otherwise
might possibly never have appeared. As the monks
of old kept the lamp of religion burning, however dimly,
until a more enlightened age, so Thomas Nutt may have
assisted in a somewhat similar manner by energetically
propounding his views, and thereby causing other apiarians
to rise up, whose names are now as familiar to us
as household words, and whose works posterity will
value. The writer of these pages has often accompanied
Mr. Nutt on his visits to his patrons in the
neighbourhood of London, and seen him perform his
operations regardless of the anger of the bees, and free
from all fear of their stings. He often expatiated on the
cruelty of the brimstone match and suffocation, denouncing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">- 62 -</span>
the barbarous custom in the following terms: "You
may as well kill the cow for her milk, or the hen for her
eggs, as the bee for its honey; why continue to light the
fatal match, when every cottager in England has the
means of saving this most useful and valuable insect?"</p>


<h3 id="NEIGHBORS_HIVE">NEIGHBOUR'S IMPROVED SINGLE BOX HIVE.</h3>

<p>We have introduced the "Single Box Hive" to suit
the convenience of those who, though desirous of keeping
bees on the improved principle, do not wish to incur
the expense or devote the space which is necessary for
Nutt's hive.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="page62" style="width: 446px;">
  <img src="images/page62.png" width="446" height="317" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">- 63 -</span></p>

<p>It consists of a lower or stock-box <span class="allsmcap">A</span>, eleven inches
square, nine inches deep, with three large windows, a
thermometer <span class="allsmcap">D</span>, as in Nutt's, being fixed across the front
one, protected at the sides by strips of glass, to prevent
the bees obscuring the quicksilver from sight, <span class="allsmcap">B</span> is a cover
the same size as the lower hive, large enough to allow
space for a bell-glass nine inches wide, six inches deep.
<span class="allsmcap">E</span> is the ventilator between the glass and the stock-hive, intended
to prevent the queen travelling into the super hive,
and also, by cooling the hive, to endeavour to prevent
swarming; a sloping pagoda roof, with an acorn top, completes
the upper story. A floor-board with a block front,
as in Nutt's collateral, forms the base, the entrance being
sunk, as before described, and furnished with zinc slides
to reduce or close it as may be required. To stock a
hive of this description, it is necessary to send the stock-box
to the party with whom you have agreed for the
supply of a swarm. In the evening of the day the hive
is thus tenanted, remove it to the position it is designed
permanently to occupy; if the swarm has to be procured
from a distance, and is transported by rail or other conveyance,
a perforated zinc slide should be substituted for
the plain slide that covers the top, and a large piece or
perforated zinc must also be tacked to the bottom after
the swarm has settled in. Thus securely confined, with a
free circulation of air throughout, bees that have been'
swarmed the day before may be safely sent any distance
that will allow of their being released the day after;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">- 64 -</span>
because bees, though they provision themselves for a
couple of days, cannot with safety be confined in an
empty hive much longer.</p>

<p>Having now, we will suppose, procured your swarm,
and placed it in a south or south-east aspect, you may,
with advantage if the weather be wet, give a little
liquid food: the feeding in this hive is performed at the
top of the stock-box, where the glass is worked. Our
round feeding pan, or the new feeding bottle, may here
be used. Any fancy as to the position may be indulged
in, but must be settled on by the time the bees are set at
liberty, because any alteration afterwards is detrimental
to the working of the hive. The bees, on first issuing
forth, carefully mark their new abode and the surrounding
objects, so that, if a change be made, they are completely
thrown out in their observations, which confuses
them not a little, and occasions loss. Bees always return
to the same spot; it is the locality that they know, and
if the hive is moved a less distance than a mile, thousands
return to the spot on which the hive has been accustomed
to stand.</p>

<p>Allow your bees to collect honey and build their combs
for ten days or a fortnight. Much now depends on the
weather; if fine, by this time they will require additional
room, which will be indicated by the thermometer <span class="allsmcap">D</span>
rapidly rising; 100 degrees is the swarming point. The
hive must be kept below this by ventilation.</p>

<p>Access must now be given to the flat bell-glass at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">- 65 -</span>
top, which is done by withdrawing the top slide. In a
few hours, sometimes immediately, the work of comb-building
begins in the glass&mdash;all the sooner, if a piece of
clean empty comb be placed therein.</p>

<p>It is of service to keep the glass warm by means of a
worsted or baize bag; it prevents the temperature from
falling at night, when much comb-building is carried on,
providing the heat is not allowed to escape. Probably,
if all goes on well, in three weeks the glass will be
found filled with fine white honey-comb. When you
find that the comb is well sealed up, it is time to take it
off; but if the cells are unfilled and unsealed, let the
labourers complete their work&mdash;a little experience will
soon enable the bee-keeper to determine this point.</p>

<p>The plan to be adopted for taking glasses of honey,
comb is the same as described for Nutt's hive.</p>


<h3 id="TAYLORS_HIVE">TAYLOR'S AMATEUR SHALLOW BOX OR
EIGHT-BAR HIVE.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" id="page66" style="width: 439px;">
  <img src="images/page66.png" width="439" height="509" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Taylor's Amateur Hive, as seen by reference to the
engraving, consists of three boxes&mdash;the lower one, <span class="allsmcap">A</span>, is
the stock-box, in which the swarm is first placed; <span class="allsmcap">B</span> is
the first super; and <span class="allsmcap">C</span>, the centre box: all three boxes are
of the same diameter, viz., thirteen and a half inches
square inside, <span class="allsmcap">A</span>, the stock-box, is seven and a half
inches deep; <span class="allsmcap">B</span>, six and a half inches: both are fitted with
eight moveable bars, each bar being one inch and an
eighth wide, with spaces of half an inch between, and all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">- 66 -</span>
easily removed by unscrewing the crown-board, in which
are two openings closed by zinc slides. The middle box,
<span class="allsmcap">C</span>, has no bars, and is still shallower than either of the
other boxes, being five inches deep. In many localities
and seasons, the third box may not be required. Each
box has two windows, one at the back and another at
the side, a zinc shutter, sliding in a groove, excluding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">- 67 -</span>
light and retaining warmth. The box <span class="allsmcap">C</span> differs from
the others in another respect; instead of bars, it has a
grating made by seven openings, each half an inch wide
and nine inches long: these three boxes stand on a stout
floor-board, in which is cut the entrance way, four inches
wide and three-eighths of an inch high. The floor-board
projects so as to support an outer cover of half-inch wood,
surmounted by a sloping roof. This is an effectual protection
from the weather, and is necessary when hives are
exposed; of course, if placed in a bee-house, such protection
may be dispensed with. The outer case is well
painted, of a green colour, and when it is used the hive
may be placed in any part of the garden. The dimensions
of this hive, with outside cover, are eighteen inches
square, and two feet six inches high.</p>

<p>Suitable stands are provided, consisting of a stout
pedestal with four feet. Stakes should be driven into
the ground to secure the whole against wind. Height
from the ground, four feet three inches.</p>

<p>The bars before alluded to are for the purpose of
inducing the bees to build parallel combs, for without
such an arrangement extraction would be impossible.
It is a great convenience, in many ways, to be able
to take out a bar of comb; it gives such a complete
control over the hive.</p>

<p>To ensure comb-building on the bars, pieces of clean
worker-comb should always be carefully preserved;
and before a swarm is put in, either every bar or, if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">- 68 -</span>
guide comb is not plentiful, every other bar should
have a piece fixed to it in the following manner:&mdash;Cut a
piece of clean empty comb of the required size, say two
inches square, not less; heat a common flat iron, with
which slightly warm the bar; then melt a little bees'-wax
upon it; draw the comb quickly over the heated iron, hold
it down on the centre of the bar, giving a very slight
movement backwards and forwards; then leave the wax
to grow cold, and, if cleverly managed, the guide will be
found firmly attached. Care must be taken that the
pitch or inclination of the comb be the same as it is in the
hives&mdash;upwards from the centre of each comb. A new
plan has lately been introduced by Mr. Woodbury, of
Exeter, to facilitate the correct construction of parallel
combs.</p>


<h3 id="NEIGHBORS_IMPROVED">NEIGHBOUR'S IMPROVED COTTAGE HIVE.</h3>

<p>Our Improved Cottage Hive is neatly made of straw,
bound with cane, and therefore very durable.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The
lower hive is covered with a wooden top, having in it
three holes, through which the bees convey their honey
into three middle-sized bell glasses with ventilators,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">- 69 -</span>
which, when filled, hold about 6 lbs. each. There is a
hoop at the bottom, another round the top of the lower
hive; to this the wooden crown-board is fastened. These
hoops are a great improvement, and are less liable to
harbour insects than if straw alone were used. The
floor-board, as its name implies, is a wooden board
one and a quarter inch thick, with a projection of three
or four inches under the entrance to form an alighting
place. This entrance is cut out of, or sunk in, the board.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> This is the hive referred to by the Bee-Master of the <i>Times</i>,
when he says:&mdash;"The second kind of hive I alluded to is made
of straw, and may be purchased at Neighbour's, in Holborn....
It is so well made that it will last very long. I have had one in
constant use during ten years, and it is still as good as when it
was bought."</p>

</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="page69" style="width: 460px;">
  <img src="images/page69.png" width="460" height="266" alt="" />
</div>

<p>There are three windows in the lower hive, each
closed with a shutter; these are very useful and interesting
for inspecting the progress made. Across the centre
window is a thermometer, enclosed at the sides by slips
of glass. The window shutters being painted green,
add very much to its appearance. The upper hive,
which is merely a cover for the glasses, is a conical-topped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">- 70 -</span>
hive, also made of straw bound with cane; a
hoop is worked into the straw, and made sufficiently
large to allow the cover to drop over the top hoop of
the lower hive, keeping the whole close, and preventing
wet from drifting in. A zinc ventilator, ornamentally
painted, forms the apex: this is useful in letting the
confined hot air pass away in warm weather. The ventilator
is opened by raising it. The dimensions of the
lower or stock-hive are fifteen inches diameter, nine and
a half inches deep outside; its weight, when empty,
seven and a half pounds. The cover, or top hive, is twelve
inches deep and fifteen inches in diameter; the ornamental
zinc top being four inches deep. The whole is
about twenty-four inches high. The weight of a hive
packed, including glasses, &amp;c., is about 18 lbs.</p>

<p>These hives have a tasteful appearance in the garden,
but they require some further protection from the weather
in the form of a cover or of a bee-house&mdash;contrivances
that have yet to be described. In extreme cold weather,
a little additional protection, by having matting folded
round them, will be advisable.</p>

<p>One of the advantages this hive has over the common
cottage hive is, that it affords opportunity for the humane
management of bees. The owner has also the power of
taking a glass of honey-comb of pure quality, free from
the extraneous matter known as "bee-bread," instead
of combs that are darkened by having brood hatched in
them. By this system, we have combs newly made and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">- 71 -</span>
used only for depositing the honey first put into them;
hence the name "virgin honey." These glasses have a
very pretty appearance, and, when nicely filled, are very
convenient for home use or for making presents. The
lower hive is the receptacle for the bees; when a swarm
is placed in this hive, they immediately proceed to fill it
with combs, in which to store honey for themselves, and
for cells to breed in. This hive remains undisturbed.</p>

<p>The best mode of tenanting a hive of this description
is by placing an early and strong swarm in it, which
may be generally procured of a neighbouring bee-keeper;
if from a distance, considerable care is necessary
to admit plenty of air; the shaking attendant upon
carriage irritates the bees so much, that, if not well ventilated,
there is danger of the swarm being stifled, and
the finer the swarm, the greater the danger. For the
purpose of ventilation, remove the slides and substitute
perforated zinc, wrapping the hive up in a coarse cloth
of open texture (dispensing with the floor-board during
transit when the distance is great).</p>

<p>It is necessary only to send the lower or stock hive to
the party furnishing the swarm, taking the precaution to
fix the slides at top with tacks, as the hive has to be inverted
to receive the bees. They are shaken into it in
the usual manner,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> as they cluster around the branch of
the tree or shrub on which they may have chosen to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">- 72 -</span>
alight. After the hiving is accomplished, the hive should
be left near to catch any stragglers, for there will always
be a few; towards evening, close the entrance, and
remove them to the exact position they are intended
permanently to occupy. Success depends on this, and
also on their careful removal on the day or evening of
swarming. The following morning the bees labour in
the new location, marking well their habitation before
they take flight, and to which they will not fail to return,
loaded with luscious store.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> Sometimes swarms alight on trunks of trees or on walls,
where it may be difficult to shake or brush them off. In the
<i>Journal of Horticulture</i>, Mr. Woodbury mentions an instance of
this kind, which he experienced last summer:&mdash;"A swarm clustered
among the large branches of a pear-tree, just at their point
of union with the trunk. In this case he merely supported
a straw hive just over the swarm with the left hand, whilst
he struck the trunk of the tree with the open palm of the right.
The vibration thus produced sent the bees up into the hive
with great rapidity, and the entire swarm was speedily hived in
the most satisfactory manner." A few whiffs of smoke will
accelerate upward movement of swarms in such circumstances.</p>

</div>

<p>A fortnight must be allowed for filling the stock-hive;
then, if the weather be fine and warm, they will prepare
to swarm again, as will be indicated by the thermometer
rising rapidly to 100 degrees or upwards. One of the
zinc slides on the wooden top must now be withdrawn,
and a bell-glass put on, covered and protected by the
upper hive; the other glasses may then be given in the
same manner, a day or two after which, should the
weather continue favourable, all signs of swarming will
at once disappear, the bees now having increased store
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">- 73 -</span>
room, which they will readily fill with comb. It is often
found useful to attach a piece of clean empty honey-comb
to the ventilating tube of the glass; it is an attraction,
and induces the bees to commence working in it
sooner than they otherwise would do. The ventilator
should always remain open during the day, to allow
the hot air to pass away from the interior, thereby contributing
to the whiteness and beauty of the work; the
bees enjoy the refreshment of coolness thereby afforded,
and they work the faster for it. At evening, all ventilation
should be stopped, and the glasses wrapped round
with flannel or some warm material, for the reasons
mentioned at <a href="#Page_65">page 65</a>.</p>

<p>The directions for taking honey are much the same as
before mentioned. Some apiarians, however, consider
that deprivation is more easily accomplished by disconnecting
the super over night, in the manner described at
<a href="#Page_58">page 58</a>. The bee-keeper, equipped with bee-dress and
gloves, must first raise the glass of comb, and, blowing a
little smoke to intimidate and drive back the bees, wedge
it up all round, an inch or so from the crown-board, by
means of three or four blocks, thus to remain all night.
This operation is best performed a little before dusk.
Bees are then less likely to come out, and if they should
do so, will speedily return. The opening in the crown-board
remains unclosed, to afford the bees the opportunity
of descending, and joining the stock-hive below,
which they will naturally do for warmth. The upper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">- 74 -</span>
straw-hive, or cover for the glasses, is better placed on
for the night. Early in the following morning, before
the bees are much about, the super will be ready for
removal. The few bees that remain within may be
speedily induced to quit, and will fly to the entrance.
The slides covering the holes in the crown-board
must be inserted, or an empty glass can be
put on, to take the full one's place. A slide seven
and a half inches square is furnished with the hive;
this is useful to remove the glass upon.</p>

<p>The holes in the wooden top of this hive are of a
peaked shape, to act as a preventive against slaughtering
any bees whilst pushing the slide in for the purpose of
removing the glass when full. The tacks before alluded
to should be removed from the slides when the hive is
fixed in its place; they are now in the way of cutting off
the glass. The entrance slide is very serviceable during
the winter months, to lessen the passage way, thereby'
preventing the admission of too much cold air: it is
also occasionally useful on a summer evening, to
lessen the entrance when moths are troublesome; for
if there be only a small opening, the bees can guard
it, and easily repulse intruders. During the time of
gathering, they require the whole width to remain
open.</p>

<p>When the weather is so unfavourable as to prevent
the bees leaving home for a few days after being hived,
it will be necessary to feed them. Bees should not be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">- 75 -</span>
fed in the midst of winter; the proper time is in the
autumn or in the spring.</p>

<p>The best mode of feeding is at the top of the stock
hive. This is done by using the round feeder.</p>

<p>The bottle feeder may be used instead of the round
feeder, and in the same place, by those who give the
preference to that method.</p>

<p>Whilst on the subject of feeding, it may be well
to suggest to the bee-keeper, that, after the honey
harvest, he should ascertain the state of the stock-hive,
because we have sometimes found that hives which were
very strong during summer, and which have yielded
a good supply of honey, have been left rather
poorly off for the winter. No doubt, under the impression
that those nicely-filled supers which the bees
intended for themselves would be amply sufficient for
their sustenance, they have, for the most part, devoted
the space below to the queen for breeding, little imagining
that the precious store would be taken away,
and consequently have left themselves too small provision
for autumn and winter.</p>

<p>The apiarian having, therefore, so richly reaped the
fruit of his bees' labours, it is but right that he should
guard against the labourers themselves suffering any
want therefrom. The state of the interior of the hive may
be ascertained by applying a weighing machine, and the
requisite supply administered by feeding. Both weighing
machine and feeder are described further on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">- 76 -</span></p>

<p>The simplicity and easy management of this hive have
deservedly rendered it an especial favourite, combining,
as it does, real utility with many conveniences to satisfy
the curious. Not a few bee-keepers desire to unite the
two qualifications, and no hives combine these advantages
in a greater degree than Neighbour's improved
cottage hive.</p>


<h3 id="IMPROVED_COTTAGE">IMPROVED COTTAGE HIVE WITHOUT WINDOWS.</h3>

<p>This hive is of precisely the same size, construction,
and management as the last mentioned, with the exception
that it has no windows or thermometer in the lower
or stock hive. The apiarian, with this hive, will have to
trust more to his own judgment as regards the likelihood
of swarming, and must watch the appearance the bees
present at the entrance. When it is time to put on
supers, in order to prevent swarming, premonition will
be given by the unusual numbers crowding about the
entrance, as well as by the heat of the weather, making
it evident that more room is required for the increasing
population.</p>

<p>Not being able to form an idea of the state of the
hive in spring and autumn by looking into the stock-hive,
it will be advisable to adopt the means of weighing.
A stock at Michaelmas should weigh 20 lbs., exclusive of
the hive, or be made up to that weight by feeding.</p>

<h3 id="LADIES_OBSERV">THE LADIES' OBSERVATORY OR CRYSTAL BEE-HIVE.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" id="page77" style="width: 200px;">
  <img src="images/page77.png" width="200" height="283" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The following engraving illustrates the construction
of the Ladies' Observatory Hive. The stock-hive is
cylindrical, with a flat top and
a hole in the centre; the dimensions
twelve and a half
inches inside, eight and a half
inches deep; the outer cover
being raised, and made of
stout glass, so as not easily to
break. A support, composed
of even wooden bars fixed on
a pedestal from the floor-board,
is very useful for the
bees to cling to and attach
their combs, instead of resting wholly against the glass.</p>

<p>The floor-board is of mahogany, the border being
French polished. A middle-sized bell-glass, for deprivation,
is placed over the hole; this hole may be closed by a
zinc slide. A cover of straw, eighteen inches deep, fifteen
inches wide, with a zinc ventilating top similar to that
affixed to the cottage hive, completes the arrangements.
The weight of the stock-hive and board is about 16 lbs.</p>

<p>This hive is well adapted for those persons who are
desirous of having the opportunity of more closely examining
the workmanship of these industrious and interesting
insects, as the whole of the interior may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">- 78 -</span>
exposed to view; it is particularly suitable for a window
or an indoor apiary, and will also be found a valuable
addition to the green-house. Under these circumstances,
the entrance-way should be covered with a flat piece of
glass, and an aperture cut in the sash corresponding
with the entrance to the hive; through the glazed passage
the bees may then find egress and ingress without
being able to gain access to the apartment. An alighting
board, four inches wide, must be fixed outside, on a level
with the entrance.</p>

<p>We had a hive of this kind in operation at the Great
Exhibitions of 1851 and 1862, fixed after the manner
above described. It answered admirably, and excited
much interest and curiosity, though placed there under
many disadvantages.</p>

<p>When a hive of this kind is to be stocked, procure an
early and strong swarm, which must be temporarily
hived in a common straw hive, from which dislodge the
bees into the glass hive, but for this purpose a little preparation
will have to be made. Spread a sheet on the
ground, place the mahogany floor-board on it with the
support, put three bricks, or some solid blocks of about
the same substance, upon which the glass will rest;
then, with a sharp and sudden blow, precipitate the
swarm out of the straw hive on to the floor-board and
support, place the glass hive on the bricks, and the bees
will collect under the bars and on to the pedestal. In
about one hour's time the whole will have settled quietly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">- 79 -</span>
and all the stragglers on the board will have collected
together, the swarm hanging pear-shaped from the bar
support; the bricks can now be removed, and the glass
put in its right place on the floor-board. The straw
cover being put on the hive, it can be removed to the
place it is destined permanently to occupy.</p>

<p>The light should not be admitted for some days after
hiving; if undisturbed, the bees will speedily build comb,
working from the wooden bars, which are placed there
for their assistance and support. In ten days or a fortnight,
if the weather continue fine and warm, they will
prepare to swarm again; the opening at the top must
now be unstopped, and the bell-glass put on, guide-comb
having been previously fixed. The directions
given for the improved cottage hive equally apply to
the ladies' observatory hive.</p>

<p>It is advisable, in winter, to furnish the glass stock-hive
with more protection from cold than is afforded by
the straw cover alone; some thick baize, or wrapper of
wadding, for which there is space between the glass hive
and the cover, will prevent so much moisture condensing
on the sides of the glass. Moisture is injurious, causing
the combs to grow mouldy; a little protection in the
way of wrapping very much prevents this.</p>

<p>The hole at top is used for supplying food, should the
apiarian fear the stock of honey is in danger of running
short; either the bottle feeder or the round feeder maybe
used for the purpose.</p>

<h3 id="COTTAGERS_HIVE">COTTAGER'S HIVE, FOR TAKING HONEY IN
STRAW CAPS, WITHOUT THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE BEES.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" id="page80" style="width: 222px;">
  <img src="images/page80.png" width="222" height="301" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A very prevalent opinion
exists, that bees do better in
straw than in hives made
of any other material. Another
opinion prevails, viz.,
that the old-fashioned
straw hive is the least
expensive, the most simple,
and the most productive.
Although we cannot go
so far as this, we are
willing to admit that a
simplified adaptation of the
humane system to the old common straw hive is the
most suitable to put into the hands of that large class of
bee-keepers&mdash;cottagers. By these the more fanciful hives
will be instantly condemned; besides, the expense puts
them quite beyond the reach of the poorer class. The
object aimed at in planning our Cottager's Hive has
been to furnish a depriving hive that should be at once
easy of management, inexpensive, and convenient. The
stock-hive, into which the bees are first hived, is a
round straw hive, having a flat top, with a hole in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">- 81 -</span>
centre. The size of this lower hive is seven or eight
inches deep, fourteen inches across the bottom, finished
with a wooden hoop, which adds very much to the firmness
and durability of the hive. The floor-board is one
and a quarter inch thick, with a way sunk therein for
the entrance. A small round mat of straw closes the
hole in the top; this mat may be fixed by wooden pegs.
We have now described what is termed the stock-hive,
which is, in fact, an old-fashioned straw hive, adapted,
modernised, and improved to the more humane, viz.,
the depriving, system. The weight of the stock-hive,
with its floor-board, is about 7 lbs.</p>

<p>The super or cap hive is about seven inches deep,
eight inches in diameter, and, when filled, contains about
10 lbs. of honey and comb. A glass window, which
is placed at the side, is useful for inspecting the progress
made in filling it!</p>

<p>A common straw hive, sufficiently deep to cover,
drops over the super, keeping the window dark, and
fitting close on to the stock-hive. This cover-hive may
be made fast by driving in two skewers, one on either
side, to keep the whole firm. Unless placed in a bee-house
or under a shed, the outside should be painted;
or a piece of oil-cloth, or water-proof covering of any
kind, shaped so as to shoot off the rain, will save the
trouble of paint, and answer the purpose. If no protection
of this sort is used, the rain is likely to rot the straw.
As a covering, cottagers often use straight stiff thatching
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">- 82 -</span>
straw, sewed together; this contrivance is termed a
"hackle," and has a pretty appearance, particularly if a
number of hives are in a row. Care has to be exercised
that mice do not make the covering hive a resting-place.
Mortar is often used for fastening round the
hive at the bottom: this is a bad plan, as it forms a
harbour for insects; the wooden hoop fits so close as to
leave little necessity for anything of the kind.</p>

<p>The principle of the depriving system is so much the
same with all our hives, that a good deal of repetition is
necessary in describing in detail the management of
each separate variety. The object aimed at with the
cottager's hive, as, indeed, with all our hives, is to
provide a compartment for the bees to live in with their
queen, she being the mother of all. It is intended, by
inducing the queen to remain in her original apartment,
that all breeding should be there performed, as well as
the storing of bee-bread and honey, for the winter
sustenance of the bees. The cap hive, or upper chamber,
known as the "super," is for the storing of honey,
which the bee-keeper looks upon as a surplus, and
which, at the close of the honey gathering, or as
soon as filled, he intends to deprive the bees of, and
appropriate to his own use, of course taking care
to leave sufficient in the lower or stock hive for winter
sustenance.</p>

<p>The mode of stocking a hive of this kind is so
familiarly known, that any who at all understand the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">- 83 -</span>
hiving of bees into a common straw hive can make no
mistake or find any difficulty in performing it. Lest
these pages should fall into the hands of persons who
are not so acquainted, we will refer them to the directions
already given at pages <a href="#Page_21">21</a> and <a href="#Page_72">72</a>.</p>

<p>The hive may be smeared inside with a little honey,
if at hand; but this is unimportant, as a clean hive
answers well. Some older bee-keepers prefer to give a
little dressing, to encourage the bees to like their new
home.</p>

<p>After the swarm has been in the hive two weeks, the
straw super hive may be put on, first removing the
straw mat, to give the bees access to it. If the hive be a
stock, that is, a swarm of the last or previous years, the
super may be put on as soon as the weather is fine and
warm, in May. But much depends on the weather and
strength of the hive, as regards the time occupied, by
the bees in filling the super; in favourable weather a
fortnight suffices.</p>

<p>If, on looking in at the little window, the bee-master
sees that the cells are sealed over, the cap of honey may
be removed in the mode already described. The cells
near the window are the last to be filled, so, when
they are sealed, it is safe to conclude that the combs
in the unseen parts are also finished.</p>

<p>Sometimes the queen ascends and deposits her eggs;
if, on turning up the super, brood be visible, replace the
cap for a few days, until the young bees quit their cells.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">- 84 -</span>
When thus emptied, honey will be deposited in lieu of
the brood.</p>

<p>Suitable pedestals for these hives to stand upon may
be obtained. It is important that these be firmly fixed,
and the hive also made fast to the stand, to prevent its
being blown over by high winds.</p>


<h3 id="WOODBURY_HIVE">WOODBURY BAR AND FRAME HIVES.</h3>

<p>Mr. Woodbury's Bar and
Frame Hive, as originally
made, consists of a wooden
box, fourteen and a half
inches square inside, nine
inches deep. This is a hive
of large size, but the actual
habitable space inside is
lessened by the room occupied by the frames, of which
there are ten; these rest on a rabbet a little below the
surface, leaving a space of three-eighths of an inch between
the upper side of the bars and the crown-board.
This allows a free passage on the top for the bees,
entirely obviating the necessity of making excavations in
the crown-board, as has hitherto been recommended.
Each frame is seven-eighths of an inch wide, and rests
in notches, with a space of half an inch between each.
The frames extend to within three-eighths of an inch of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">- 85 -</span>
the floor-board, so as to hang without touching any part,
leaving about the same distance from the sides. It will
be seen that there is a free passage for the bees on
every side, and they are thus kept from coming in contact
with the sides of the hive. Our engraving shows the
hive open, and exposes to view the top of the ten bars
and frames, as they range from back to front. A
window is also shown; this is placed in the engraving
over the entrance, but the proper position would be just
opposite. The drawing is made so as to show back and
front at once. The floor-board is one and a quarter inch
thick, having two "keys" on the under side to prevent
warping.</p>

<p id="WOODBURY_STRAW">WOODBURY STRAW BAR AND FRAME HIVE.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="page85" style="width: 284px;">
  <img src="images/page85.png" width="284" height="208" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Since the introduction of the wood hive by Mr. Woodbury,
that gentleman has recommended, in the <i>Journal
of Horticulture</i>, that the stock-hive be made of straw, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">- 86 -</span>
exactly the same dimensions; this material being wanner
in winter, slightly ventilating, and allowing of absorption.
Bees, during cold weather, cluster together to
generate the requisite degree of heat; the temperature
of the interior of the hive being thus so much higher
than the external atmosphere, a good deal of moisture
condenses at the top and on the sides of the hive. The
straw, as before stated, prevents this dampness hanging
about the hive, and tends to keep the inmates more
healthy. Dampness in a hive is a fruitful source of
mischief, causing empty combs to grow mouldy, and is
injurious in many ways.</p>

<p>The square straw hives, and a machine for making
them, exhibited in the Austrian department of the International
Exhibition of 1862, suggested the idea of employing
that material for English bar and frame hives. We
have had a machine made somewhat similar to the one
exhibited, and suited to the size of our hives, by which
our hive-maker is able to manufacture neat square straw
hives. These have a wood frame at top, an inch deep,
with the requisite notches to allow the ten-comb frames
to hang. A similar frame forms the base, the straw
being worked between. The floor-board is one and a
quarter inch thick, "keyed" with stout keys, as before
mentioned. An inch projection is left on all sides
beyond the exterior of the hive, from which it is slightly
chamfered down. An entrance, four inches wide, is
cut out of the substance of the board, beginning at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">- 87 -</span>
the edge, and continuing on the same level until inside
the hive, where it slopes upwards. This entrance is about
three-eighths of an inch high where the hive crosses it.</p>

<p>These straw hives have been generally made without
windows, as Mr. Woodbury and other scientific apiarians
so prefer them. They consider that glass windows are
unsuited for winter, because then moisture condenses on
the glass. There is no doubt that the having a peep-hole
or two in a hive adds very agreeably to its value
for amateur bee-keepers, and, to meet the wishes of
such, we have had straw hives constructed with windows.
It is not every one who would like to lift out the frames as
often as is necessary for an inspection of the state of the
colony, nor, perhaps, is it advisable to be often thus
meddling. The windows have also a very neat appearance.
We have hives with one, and some with two and
three windows; of course, a little extra expense is incurred
where these are made, but that is not objected to
by those who approve of the additional convenience.
The crown-board (if correct to call a straw top by that
name) has, like the hive, a frame of wood all round,
and a square, piece of wood in the centre, with a two-inch
hole; this hole is for the purpose of administering
food, in a mode to be explained hereafter. A circular
block of wood, four inches in diameter, closes the
opening.</p>

</div>

<p>Some bee-keepers like to be able to make a full and
daily inspection of the hive; we have, therefore, prepared
a few hives, constructed of wooden frames, enclosed
on all sides and on the top with window-glass.
The dimensions are precisely the same as those before
mentioned, and allow the same number of bars and
frames (ten). The crown has a round hole cut in the
glass to admit of feeding. The four sides are constructed
of double glass, to preserve the bees from variations of
temperature. We cannot, however, recommend this
hive for a winter residence for the bees; we should
prefer lifting the combs out with the bees, and placing
them in a straw hive of similar construction, to pass
through the ordeal of the winter season. A stock of
bees might be kept through the year in a hive of this
kind, but would require well wrapping round to keep
out the cold. There should be a small glass over the
hole at top, so as to allow the moisture to arise and condense,
instead of doing so in the hive. The operation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">- 89 -</span>
of exchanging the hive is so easy, that we should be content
to place a stock in one, say, from April to September,
and shift it in the autumn. Such a hive is a very
pleasing object of interest, as in it the whole commonwealth
of bees is exposed, to view; and the hive need not
be obscured from daylight, provided it be protected from
sun and rain. All the external wood-work is of oak-colour,
varnished, so that the appearance of the Glass
Bar and Frame Hive is extremely neat and much
approved of.</p>


<h3 id="FRAME">FRAMES.</h3>

  <img src="images/page89.png" width="157" height="86" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As before mentioned, each
stock-hive has ten of these frames&mdash;each thirteen inches long, by
seven and a quarter inches high,
with a five-eighths of an inch projection at each upper
end, which rests in the notch, either back or front.
The width, both of the bar and frame, is seven-eighths
of an inch; this is less, by a quarter of an inch, than the
bar recommended by the older apiarians. Mr. Woodbury&mdash;whose
authority on the modern plans for keeping
bees is of great weight&mdash;finds the seven-eighths of an
inch bar an improvement, because with them the combs
are closer together, and require fewer bees to cover the
brood. Then, too, in the same space that eight old-fashioned
bars occupied, the narrower frames admit of
an additional bar, so that, by using these, increased
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">- 90 -</span>accommodation is afforded for breeding and the storing
of honey.</p>


<h3 id="IMPROVED_COMB_BAR">IMPROVED COMB BAR.</h3>

  <div class="figcaption">Section of Bar.</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Woodbury says that this little contrivance
has proved very effectual in securing
straight combs when guide-combs are not
obtainable. The lower angles are rounded
off, whilst a central rib is added, of about
one-eighth of an inch in breadth and depth.
This central rib extends to within half an inch
of each end, where it is removed, in order to admit of the
bar fitting into the usual notch. All that is necessary to
ensure the regular formation of combs is, to coat the
underneath surface of the central rib with melted wax.
Mr. Woodbury further says: "My practice is to use plain
bars whenever guide-combs are attainable, as those can
be attached with much greater facility to a plain than
to a ribbed bar; but whenever I put in a bar without
comb, I always use one of the improved ones. By this
method, crooked and irregular combs are altogether
unknown in my apiary."</p>

<p>Most of our bars are made with the ridge; but should
any of our customers prefer the flat ones, we keep a
few to supply their requirements.</p>

<p>With the moveable bar and frame hive, every comb
is available for extraction, and may easily be taken out
of the hive; each comb being fixed within its frame,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">- 91 -</span>
there is less disturbance to the bees than if the combs
were fixed to the sides, as is the case with ordinary hives.
A strip of wood, about half an inch wide, rests on the
floor-board; in this strip are ten notches, made to receive
the lower part of the frames, so as to retain them in their
places at equal distances from each other. A difficulty
is found, with a well-stocked hive, in dropping the frames
into the exact notches, so that it is not necessary to have
these rack works always in use; but when any movement
of the hive is made, it is essential to have the
frames firmly fixed by the aid of this contrivance. It is
also advisable to have the frames perpendicularly supported
until the combs are built, so, in order that the
frames should hang true, the hive ought to be on the
level. A little inclination may be given to it from back
to front, causing the hive to fall slightly towards the
entrance, so as to allow the moisture inside the hive,
caused by the exhalations of the bees, to run off.</p>


<h3 id="COMPOUND_BAR_FRAME">COMPOUND BAR FRAME.</h3>

<div class="figright" id="page91" style="width: 152px;">
  <img src="images/page91.png" width="152" height="82" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In the <i>Journal of Horticulture</i>,
Mr. Woodbury thus describes the
compound bar frame. Being his
own adaptation, we cannot do
better than use his own words:&mdash;"This is a contrivance
of my own, which I have found very advantageous in
enabling me to use frames in stock-hives, and bars in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">- 92 -</span>
supers, without forfeiting the advantages arising from
the unlimited interchangeability of every comb in every
hive and super in the apiary. Its construction will be
readily understood by an inspection of the annexed sketch,
in which the comb bar is shown slightly raised from its
frame. The bar itself is thirteen and a quarter inches
long, by seven-eighths of an inch wide, and three-eighths
of an inch thick. When the comb bar is in its place,
the whole forms a frame thirteen inches long, by seven
and a quarter inches high (inside measure), with five-eighths
of an inch projection at each end, which rests
in its appropriate notch in either the back or front of
the hive. When filled with comb, the bar becomes so
firmly cemented to the frame as to admit of its being
handled with facility." This contrivance is, no doubt,
very excellent in the hands of Mr. Woodbury; but in the
hands of the unpractised severe mishaps may arise. In
warm weather the propolis and wax, with which the bees
cement the bar to the frame, become soft; consequently,
in handling the frames, unless dexterity is used, the comb
is likely to drop out. We therefore recommend that
the bar and frame be made both in one: greater firmness
and simplicity are thereby gained. Some of these
compound bars and frames are kept in stock at our
establishment, though they cannot be recommended for
general use; but should anyone prefer them, they can
be supplied at the same price as the common frames.
In describing the stock-hives of wood, straw, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">- 93 -</span>
glass, allusion has frequently been made to the depriving
hives technically called "supers." These are also made
of glass, in wood frames, thirteen inches inside, six inches
deep, with eight bars (without frames). The above
engraving represents the super used with the bar and
frame hive.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="page93" style="width: 284px;">
  <img src="images/page93.png" width="284" height="159" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Honey-combs in supers are better when made thicker
than those for breeding, consequently the bars are placed
a little further apart than in the lower or stock hive; they
are either the Woodbury Ribbed, contrived to induce
the straight building of combs, or flat bars with guide-combs
affixed.</p>


<h3 id="COVERS">COVERS.</h3>

<p>A loose outer case, forming a complete cover for the
hive, is found very useful. The case is made in two
parts, for convenience the roof is also separate, having
an acorn at top, which forms a neat finish. These outside
cases are made of wood, and drop lightly over all;
when thus protected, and fixed on a pedestal, the hive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">- 94 -</span>
may be placed in the open air in such position as fancy
may dictate. The aspect should be south or south-east,
and, if against a wall, sufficient space must be allowed
for a free passage behind, as it is from thence all operations
must be conducted by the apiarian. The case and
roof, with the stand, being the only parts exposed to the
weather, will be the only portions that require painting;
they are sometimes stained and varnished, and we are
inclined to prefer the latter for appearance. Should
the apiarian have a complete bee-hive house, the cover,
and stands will not be needed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="page94" style="width: 255px;">
  <img src="images/page94.png" width="255" height="350" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When removing or replacing the covers, care should
be taken to do so very gently, or the bees will be enraged,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">- 95 -</span>
and rush out, and may inflict stings upon those within
their reach. We have obviated the necessity for lifting
off the cover for the purpose of looking in, either at
the window of the stock-hive or of the super, by making
a door, both in the upper and lower parts of the outside
case. These doors, or unglazed windows, are hinged
at the bottom, so as to open downwards, rendering
inspection easy, without disturbance to the bees.</p>

<p>A wooden range for supporting a number of hives
makes a safe and economical stand; it may be formed
by driving firmly into the ground two rows of posts, each
row about twelve inches apart; to these two rails, about
two inches square, are nailed, and upon these the hives
firmly rest. Care should be taken not to have the hives
nearer together than eighteen inches; the intermediate
space will be found very convenient on which to rest the
cover, or for supporting an empty hive during the proper
performance of any operation.</p>

<p>Mr. Woodbury has his hives arranged on rails, somewhat
after the plan before described.</p>

<p>In describing, as above, the various hives and frames,
some hints have been given as to the methods of handling
them. This, however, will not suffice for an induction
to the mysteries of practical bee-keeping, and we must
refer the reader to a subsequent section, wherein the
details as to manipulation will be fully explained, and
the results of the experience of several distinguished
apiarians will be embodied.</p>

<p>This hive is similar in principle to the cottager's.
It is also similar in size, with the exception of being
quite straight at the sides. A zinc rim affords protection
from the weather. Under the upper straw hive a
bell-glass is worked. A mahogany adapting board,
with a four-inch hole in the centre, corresponding with
that of the hive, supplies an even surface for the glass to
rest on, and facilitates its removal when full. For particulars

</div>

<p>This is an ingenious contrivance of Mr. Taylor's.
Hoops are worked in the straw, both at the top and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">- 97 -</span>
bottom of the stock-hive, and in the upper hoop are
openings cut to receive eight comb bars; each bar is
one inch and an eighth wide, with a space of half an
inch between. Since the introduction
of square straw bar
and frame hives, these hives
have not been much in request.
Considerable inconvenience is
found to arise, because the
bars, being of unequal lengths,
cannot be interchanged one
with the other.</p>

<p>The description given of
Taylor's Amateur Hive, and
mode of stocking and furnishing
it with guide-comb, apply to this hive. The large
straw hive raised up in the engraving is an outside case;
the roof is a large zinc cover. If placed in a bee-house,
the outside case and zinc roof are not required.</p>


<h3 id="NEIGHBORS_UNICOMB">NEIGHBOUR'S UNICOMB OBSERVATORY HIVE.</h3>

<p>This hive is well adapted for those persons who are
desirous of having the opportunity of closely examining
the workmanship of the industrious and interesting inmates.
It is particularly intended for a window recess
or an indoor apiary, and will also be found an interesting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">- 98 -</span>
addition to the green-house. Bees cease to appear
disturbed when exposure to the light is continuous. This
discovery enables the bee-keeper to gain a full inspection.
The hive should be screened from the direct rays
of the sun, which would worry the inmates, and be
otherwise prejudicial. An aperture should be cut in
the sash corresponding with the entrance to the hive,
through which the bees may find egress and ingress,
without being able to gain access to the apartment,
as described for the ladies' observatory hive (<a href="#Page_78">page 78</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="page98" style="width: 300px;">
  <img src="images/page98.png" width="300" height="209" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The unicomb hive is constructed of so narrow a
width between thin plates of glass that it admits of one
comb <i>only</i> to be built, and, at the same time, leaves
space between the comb and the glass on either side for
the bees to pass and repass. It is thus made so that
every bee may be exposed to view. The queen forming
the most prominent feature of attention, she is readily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">- 99 -</span>
distinguished by the greater length of her body, as well
as by the attention paid her by the other bees.</p>

<p>The mode of stocking this hive is as follows:&mdash;Procure
a strong swarm, if practicable, and let it be first
hived into a common straw hive in the usual way. Take
care to make the necessary preparations previous to
the operation of stocking: for this purpose, at evening
time, place the hive on its side, oil the ground (having
already spread a sheet, or large white cloth, underneath);
unfasten the side of the hive which is hinged, turn this
sash quite back, very gently lift the straw hive containing
the swarm; then, with a sudden shake, dash as large a
portion of the bees into the unicomb hive as can be done
in a few seconds. Have ready a feather or, better still
(because firmer), a goose-wing; with this, quickly brush
the bees off the edges of the frames, also from the
rabbets against which the glass side closes, in order to
prevent killing any; then gently spread them, so that
the glass, when closed, shall not shut against the congregated
mass in the middle. When thus ready for
closing up, which should be quickly done, fasten the
side, and turn the hive right end upwards, with the
entrance towards those bees that are outside. The
bees will not, probably, have all been ejected from
the straw hive at the first brush, and will require
a few sharp raps on the cloth to clear the hive.
The moving mass now congregating without, upon
discovering that so large a portion of their companions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">- 100 -</span>
have found a home, with (as is generally the case) the
queen safely housed, will hasten to join them. It is a
pretty sight to see the labourers crowding in like a
little army, with their heads pointing in the same direction,
making for the desired home, which they will slowly
but surely enter, with fanning wings and a happy hum.</p>

<p>Considerable help may be afforded by gently collecting
the stragglers in a table-spoon, and shaking them off
close to the entrance.</p>

<p>In about an hour, all the bees will have entered the
hive, which may now be bodily taken to the place previously
made ready for it, and which it is intended permanently
to occupy,&mdash;a shelf, the size of the bottom of
the hive, with a sloping piece of wood four inches wide,
forms a firm bracket and a substantial stand,&mdash;these
and all other preparations, such as cutting the opening,
fixing the alighting-board, &amp;c., having been previously
accomplished when the hive was empty.</p>

<p>It will be as well to screen the hive from view for a
few days, until the bees become settled in their new
domicile. Although this hive is constructed of double
glass, to keep up a more uniform degree of warmth,
still, from the cold nature of glass, and the close contact
into which the bees are brought with it, it is advisable to
place flannel between the outer shutters and the glass of
the hive, on both sides. Such precaution is found essential
if the bees remain in this hive during whiter, and
very much adds to their comfort on cold nights at most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">- 101 -</span>
periods of the year. In the day time, in summer months,
the hive being of double glass, the whole may be fully
exposed to view. If the temperature of the apartment
in which the hive stands be kept at 60 degrees, this extra
attention will not be so needful. As soon as the bees
are settled, comb-building will immediately commence,
and in about two weeks' time there will be comb spreading
over the whole hive. The queen may be viewed
depositing her eggs, and all the usual operations of the
rearing of brood, storing of honey, and the building of
combs, will be open to full inspection, with perfect ease
to the spectator. As an object of lively and permanent
interest for the breakfast-parlour or conservatory, the
unicomb observatory hive may be regarded as infinitely
superior to an aquarium or fernery.</p>

<p>At the Exposition Universelle of 1855, in Paris, we
exhibited a hive of this description in full working; order.
The bees left London on the 5th of July of that year,
and were placed in the Exposition on the following
morning. An entrance was made for them through
the side of the building, as before explained. Our bees
had no national antipathies, and they immediately sallied
forth to their "fresh fields and pastures new" in the
Champs Elysees, the gardens of the Tuileries, the
Luxembourg, &amp;c., whence they soon returned laden with
luscious store from French flowers.</p>

<p>The Jurors of the Exposition awarded us a prize medal
for bee-hives.</p>

<h3 id="WOODBURY_UNICOMB">WOODBURY UNICOMB HIVE.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" id="page102" style="width: 412px;">
  <img src="images/page102.png" width="412" height="313" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Woodbury Unicomb Hive has many advantages
over similar hives as previously constructed. The
engraving shows the interior compartment divided into
six; these are sis Woodbury frames. The inner sash
opens, to admit of hanging up the frames on the
notches prepared for them. The width of the hive
between the glasses of the sashes is just sufficient to
admit of one thickness of comb, with space on each
side for the bees to pass and repass, the same as in
Neighbour's unicomb. There is, however, a great
advantage in the use of this hive; with it, anyone possessing
a Woodbury box or straw bar and frame hive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">- 103 -</span>
can readily commence an unicomb, and as readily put
the combs and bees back into the square hive again.
The outside shutters on each side are composed of
Venetian blinds, admitting daylight, but obscuring the
rays of the sun. We had the entrance made at one end,
as represented in our drawing; this alteration was made
after the pattern of the hive from which Mr. Woodbury
allowed us to copy. His own was intended to stand
wholly out of doors, and had two central entrances, one
on each side at the bottom, the hive itself turning on
a pivot.</p>

<p>When the hive was being examined on one side, the
entrance was closed by a piece of wood inserted in it;
and when the other side was brought round to be
inspected, the piece of wood was withdrawn, and placed
in the opposite entrance. This was a most ingenious
contrivance; but it did not answer our purpose for indoors.
When Mr. Woodbury sent us his hive, we were
preparing for the International Exhibition of 1862, and,
in placing it against the sides of the building, we followed
our old plan for ingress by having the entrance at
the end. Since that time, we have made a considerable
improvement by adapting Mr. Woodbury's cleverly contrived
turn-table to suit our own hive. Like Mr. Woodbury's
hive, ours has two iron wheels, the one fixed to
the bottom of the hive, the other fixed to a stout board
running the full length of the hive; on these two wheels
the whole hive turns. In the centre there is an opening
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">- 104 -</span>
into the hive, with a passage-way running underneath,
so that the bees' entrance is in no way affected by the
position of the hive, which revolves, to suit the convenience
of visitors inspecting it. Should the queen, with
her attendants, not be visible on one side, the other side
of the comb can be brought into full view, and examined
with the same facility as a picture, or as articles are
inspected in a shop window. Thus, in the unicomb
observatory hive, the sovereign mother, her train of
servitors, the drones, with their aimless movements, and
the crowd of ever-busy workers&mdash;either building their
combs or storing honey&mdash;may be always seen, as presenting
a veritable <i>tableau vivant</i>.</p>

<p>Another improvement that we have made upon Mr.
Woodbury's pattern is, that of accommodating the
frames; his was constructed before frame-hives were in
use, consequently it is only suitable for combs on bars.
Our adaptation has necessitated an increase in size. The
outside dimensions are nearly three feet square, and
seven inches deep from back to front. Provision is made
at top for feeding, and for working two small flat-top
glasses for deprivation, which are protected by the
weather-board.</p>

<p>An alighting-board is placed at the centre, close
under the entrance, when the hive is located out-of-doors.
When the hive is placed indoors, a passage-way,
about eighteen inches long, covered with glass, is fixed
to the entrance, the other end communicating with an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">- 105 -</span>
opening in the wall or sash; through this the bees find
access, an alighting-board being fixed outside the building.
It is requisite that the passage-way be about this
length, in order to allow the hive to turn round clear
of the side of the building.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1863, we had ample proof of the
success of this hive during its exhibition at the annual
show of the Bath and West of England Agricultural
Society at Exeter.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> We selected six combs, and packed
them in one of the square box Woodbury bar and
frame hives, and, on arrival at Exeter, Mr. Woodbury
assisted us in taking out the frames and placing them
in the unicomb. That being fixed against the boarded
side of a shed, we found the covered way a great convenience,
and it answered remarkably well; the bees
did not seem to be inconvenienced by having to travel
through so long a passage. A glass covering admitted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">- 106 -</span>
a full view of the little labourers as they crowded in,
and the sight of them very much enhanced the interest
of visitors examining the hive.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> It may require explanation how it was that we took bees to
Exeter, which sounds something like "carrying coals to Newcastle."
The reason was this&mdash;the garden of our friend, Mr.
Woodbury, at Mount Radford, from which we could have been
supplied, was so near to the show yard, that he was apprehensive
a large number of the bees would return to their old hives. Our
bees from a distance would, according to their nature, return to
their own hive, for bees, although they may be moved miles
away, take care to mark their new position, and are careful to
return to it. Mr. Woodbury lent us a small stock of his Ligurian
bees, and between it and our own hive the crowd of visitors
divided their attention.</p>

</div>

<p>Since the time before mentioned, we have exhibited
bees at the meetings of the Bath and West of England
Agricultural Society at Bristol, and of the Royal Agricultural
Society at Newcastle, in 1864. On both occasions,
further proof was given that this hive admirably
answers the purpose intended, and it afforded pleasure
and interest to many thousands of visitors.</p>

<p>The unicomb hive may be stocked in two ways,
which have been previously referred to. The bee-keeper
may either select the comb upon which the queen
is found, and put it into the hive, and so form an artificial
swarm, or he may take six brood-combs from a
hive, and so stock the unicomb at once, which we did
for the show at Exeter.</p>

<p>The former plan is, perhaps, the most advisable,
because new comb has to be built within the five frames;
for, be it remembered, in this case five empty frames
must be put in. It is 9, better plan still, if artificial combs
are placed in each frame, so as to afford an interesting
opportunity of watching the formation of the cells
therein. The combs are sure to be dark in colour when
taken from a stock-hive, and new combs, being whiter,
have a better appearance in the hive. The comb upon
which the queen was introduced may be taken away
after the artificial swarm has made combs within some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">- 107 -</span>
of the other five frames; when the queen is on one of the
new combs, opportunity may easily be taken for opening
the hive and removing the old dark comb. The bees
can easily be shaken or brushed off the comb, and will
return to the hive. The comb, with the unhatched brood,
may be deposited in any square hive that needs strengthening.
We mention this, to show how to obtain a hive
with entirely fine white comb.</p>

<p>If the possessor of a square Woodbury frame-hive
wishes to start a strong unicomb hive, and does not
object to appropriate the stock, he must take out of the
Woodbury hive any six combs on the frames, and put
the unicomb in its place so as to receive all the returning
bees that happen to be abroad; the remaining four
combs, supposing there are ten, can be inserted in any
other frame-hives in the garden in which there may be
vacancies.</p>

<p>We have had this hive in operation, in the manner
last described, during the summer of 1863, and found it
to answer remarkably well. On a lawn, placed on a
suitable ornamental stand, it formed a pleasing object,
besides affording great interest and instruction.</p>

<p>In unicomb hives stocked with a natural swarm (as is
generally the plan), there is considerable difficulty in
keeping the bees alive through the winter. In a hive
where the combs are removable, no loss of bees need
be occasioned. We do not recommend the hive we are
now describing as a winter residence for bees. For
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">- 108 -</span>
four months in the year, when bees are most active, and
when their operations are most interesting, this hive may
be brought into use, either of the two plans before described
being adopted. An artificial swarm should be
put in during May or June, and taken out, in the method
before mentioned, and then placed in the square box
during the month of September; sometimes it may do
for a stock to be put in a month or so earlier, but it
should never be retained later in this hive. In October,
we often have cold nights; the bees and brood being in
such close contact with the glass, and not able to cluster
as is their natural wont, suffer from exposure to the
variations of temperature. In some degree to moderate
this, we have used treble glass with a space between
each square; greater warmth is thus obtained, and the
view is not intercepted. Opportunity should be taken
for cleaning the unicomb hive when empty, so as to
be ready for re-stocking as a new hive in the following
summer. The unicomb observatory hive is one
which might have been suggested by the lines of
Evans:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Stewarton Hive is so
often spoken of, and in such
favourable terms, by bee-keepers,
that we deem it necessary
to give it a place here,
and to supply some explanation
of its construction and management.
We consider this especially
needful, as some of the
principles of its management
are so imperfectly understood,
that frequent mistakes are
made, and also because, for
the convenience of bee-keepers, we keep a supply of
these hives on hand.</p>

<p>The name is derived from their having been first manufactured
at Stewarton, in Scotland; and they are still
made so well, and at so moderate a price in that country,
that London workmen are unable to compete in their
manufacture. Our supply is therefore from that source;
so that, with a little addition for carriage, the price
approximates that of the makers themselves, affording a
convenience to many of our apiarian friends in being
able to obtain these hives in London.</p>

<p>Our engraving shows the four boxes set up. These
constitute the hive. We will suppose that the young
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">- 110 -</span>
bee-keeper has just received the four octagonal boxes,
with the bundles of grooved slides (of which there are
nearly forty); about one half of these slides are short
pieces, similarly cut to the longer ones. These are to
fill up the openings where the slides are not put in, or are
required to be withdrawn, as hereafter explained. He
will find himself in possession of four boxes so neatly
dove-tailed on the bevel, that, if he be of a mechanical
turn, he will not only be surprised at the way in which
they are put together, but also at the price for which they
are offered. Three of the boxes, <span class="allsmcap">A, B, C</span>, technically
called "body boxes," are precisely similar, each being
fourteen inches in diameter and five and a half inches
deep inside. Nine bars range along the top of each
box. These are not movable, but are so constructed to
induce the correct and regular building of the combs.
The fourth box, <span class="allsmcap">D</span>, is the depriving box or super, is only
four inches deep, and the same in diameter as the others.
This being the honey-box, it is furnished with seven
wide fixed bars, instead of nine, because, as stated at
<a href="#Page_93">page 93</a>, bees construct deeper receptacles to contain
the honey than for breeding in: thus, should the queen
go up into this compartment, she may find the cells are
too much elongated to enable her to reach the base,
when her body is inserted for the purpose of depositing
an egg. We have too much confidence in her majesty's
sagacity to expect her to make such an attempt in honey-cells
thus elongated; doubtless she will only look and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">- 111 -</span>
pass on, seeking more suitable depositories, and confine
her nursery to those lower regions where she is
welcome. The honey is thus kept pure, and that which
not unfrequently mars the qualify of a super&mdash;viz., cells
that either contain brood or have been bred in&mdash;is prevented.
Each box is furnished with two small windows,
back and front, closed by sliding shutters, by which
opportunity is afforded for inspecting the progress made,
and also of knowing when the time has arrived that the
cells are filled and the box may be taken away.</p>

<p>Each of the boxes, <span class="allsmcap">A, B, C</span>, is furnished with an entrance-way,
four inches wide, half an inch high, a
wooden slide either wholly or partially closing same, as
required. When at work, the bees only need one entrance
open, and that at the lowest box. The long
slides before mentioned are pushed in to their respective
receptacles from the back of the hive, to close the openings
between the bars; <span style="border: 1px dashed #aaa;">those</span> of them that are shorter
will be seen to belong to the sides of the octagon, and
the ends are cut angular to suit the form of the box.
A little examination will suffice to show the right allotment
of the slides, the appropriation of which may be
said somewhat to resemble the putting together of a
child's puzzle.</p>

<p>The box <span class="allsmcap">B</span> must be left open at the interstices that correspond
with the box <span class="allsmcap">A</span>, placed above, the little openings
being closed by the insertion of the ten sections of slides,
thus leaving free communication inside with the upper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">- 112 -</span>
box <span class="allsmcap">A</span>, and admitting of no outlet for the bees, except
at the entrance.</p>

<p>When the four boxes are placed above each other, the
structure measures twenty-two inches high.</p>

<p>The Scotch carpenters send no floor-board, and no
covering or roof for the top to shoot off the rain; they
evidently expect that the purchaser is provided with a
shed or bee-house of some kind, and also with a floor-board.
Should the apiarian, however, not have these
necessaries, we can supply the deficiency.</p>

<p>The sides of the boxes are furnished with wooden
buttons, which, when turned round, keep each box
exactly in its place above the other: there are also
projecting irons or screw heads for tying the two
boxes <span class="allsmcap">A</span> and <span class="allsmcap">B</span> together, preparatory to hiving the
swarm; or if the boxes stand out exposed, all may be
thus secured, to prevent their being blown over by high
winds.</p>


<h4><i>Directions for Management.</i></h4>

<p>Take the two boxes <span class="allsmcap">A</span> and <span class="allsmcap">B</span>, made one by the junction
before mentioned, and similarly inside by the free communication
afforded. Shake the swarm in as described
at <a href="#Page_28">page 28</a>, just as with a common cottage hive.</p>

<p>If the weather be favourable, these two boxes will be
nearly filled in ten days. To get the full advantage of
the Stewarton hive the first year, put two swarms into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">- 113 -</span>
two body boxes, <span class="allsmcap">A</span> and <span class="allsmcap">B</span>; if the two are too small,
then add the other box <span class="allsmcap">C</span>. Allow the bees to remain there
till they have nearly filled the body boxes with comb,
which (with this increased number of workers, and in
favourable weather) should be from five to ten days.
Two swarms are seldom procurable the same day, so as
then to be joined together, and even if they were, there
is a doubt whether greater progress may not be attained
by hiving a swarm a week or so earlier than the other,
so as to build comb and raise brood ready for the reception
of the new comers.</p>

<p>The second swarm is added best in the evening, after
the bees have ceased working. For this purpose spread
a sheet on the ground, place two sticks so as to prevent
the box being close to the ground, then, with a sudden
knock, eject the bees of the second swarm on to the
cloth, and place the two body boxes that contain the
earlier swarm over the dislodged bees; these will,
in the course of an hour or so, ascend and become
one family, and one of the queens will be speedily
destroyed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, prepare the shallow honey-box <span class="allsmcap">D</span>, by
fixing small pieces of worker guide-comb, of pure white
colour, on the centre of each side bar. If, however, a
box of honey with neatly made, straight, and quite
regular comb be desired, a piece of this guide-comb
must be fixed to the centre of each bar. If guide-comb
be unobtainable, strips of the impressed wax sheets
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">- 114 -</span>
or artificial comb (hereafter described) will be found
excellent substitutes.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> The body boxes may be prepared in a similar manner.</p>

</div>

<p>When selecting guide-comb, avoid combs with drone-cells;
to fix these is setting the bees a bad pattern.
Honey stored in drone-combs has more wax, and is
coarser in appearance and taste. Having satisfied yourself,
by peeping in at the windows, and from symptoms
at the entrance, that the original boxes are well filled,
place your prepared honey-box on the top, draw a
slide at each side of the middle box to afford communication,
and insert the little plugs. It is not so well to
withdraw the middle slides, because the queen is more
likely to ascend from the centre. When you notice that
the bees have fairly commenced work in the honey-box
and are likely to keep to it, the remaining box <span class="allsmcap">C</span>
may be added below the stock, which will afford additional
room and prevent swarming, exchanging the
entrance to the newly-furnished box and sliding in
pieces wood to close the aperture of that above.</p>

<p>Should the bees begin making comb in the bottom
box, draw two more slides for freer access into the
super, as there will then be little risk of the queen ascending,
having so much range for egg-laying in the three
lower boxes.</p>

<p>In very fine weather, a good swarm or stock will fill a
honey-box in the space of two weeks; but a much longer
time is usually occupied.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">- 115 -</span></p>
<p>The more quickly the box is filled, the purer will be
the colour of the comb and honey, because bees very
much discolour their work when they have it long on
hand. Before taking off the honey-box, observe particularly
that the combs are well sealed at the windows,
because, as mentioned at <a href="#Page_83">page 83</a>, this portion of the
work is always left till the last.</p>

<p>When you see that all is ready for the removal of a
box, select the middle of a fine day for the purpose
(not omitting to don the bee-armour). Draw out one
or two of the slides, and give the bees a few
gentle puffs, either of fungus or of tobacco smoke,
from the tube fumigator, which will cause the majority
of the bees to descend into the body of the hive;
then stop the communication, by pushing in the slides.
Next, with a spatula, make a slight opening for a piece
of strong thin twine at the front of the box, and
immediately behind the thread two thin wedges; with
the two ends in hand, work the twine gently forward,
bringing the wedges, after, until the opposite side is
reached. This will remove any obstruction caused by
the bees having attached their combs to the top of the
next box, and thus leave the super entirely free for
removal. It will be as well, for the reasons stated at
<a href="#Page_58">page 58</a>, not to remove the box immediately. After
waiting an hour, the box may be taken off, and conveyed
to a quiet place. Should any bees remain, they will be
glad, after their confinement, to escape to the parent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">- 116 -</span>
hive; or if you have an empty hive to put over, by gently
drumming the sides, the remaining bees will ascend and
leave the box at your disposal. The bees driven into
the empty box may now be shaken out in front of the
mouth of the hive. Another plan is to cut off the communication
over night, and raise the hive on wedges, as
recommended to be adopted with the super (<a href="#Page_73">page 73</a>).</p>

<p>Before winter sets in, the box <span class="allsmcap">C</span> may be removed and
the comb it contains (if well filled) be used for consumption:
if the comb be empty, let it remain carefully
preserved from moth and insects; it will be invaluable
next season. Empty comb may be thus preserved by
tying or pasting a piece of stout newspaper closely
round the bottom, and keeping the box in a dry place.</p>

<p>Feeding, when required, may be liberally pursued, by
withdrawing two slides and supplying a bottle-feeder.
Enough food should be given in the early autumn to last
until spring.</p>

<p>The chief value of the Stewarton hive consists in the
boxes being shallow, so that the combs are more
likely to be well filled down to the base. This is a great
advantage with supers, particularly when required to be
sent to a distance, as there is less likelihood of the combs
breaking down. A fine super of honey, that would be
valuable, is materially depreciated when it reaches its
destination in a damaged state, with the honey running
from the cells. For the same reason, when the weather
is hot and the rays of the sun fall on the hive, the combs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">- 117 -</span>
might part from their foundations if there were no intermediate
bars, which is now the case in the stock-hive,
composed as it is of two boxes. If these two boxes were
in one, the depth of each comb would be twelve inches;
and when filled with brood and honey, would probably
weigh 10 lbs. This is a great weight to be supported in
hot summer weather, when the wax is softened by the
heat. Another distinguishing feature that the Stewarton
hive possesses is the use of the box <span class="allsmcap">C</span>, which, by
giving increased room, as the season advances, prevents
what is often an annoyance to the apiarian, viz.,
a late swarm&mdash;too late to be of any value, and impoverishing
the stock by a division of its numbers, thereby
perhaps impeding the completion of the super. A further
advantage of the box c, is that it induces the bees (who
frequently hang in dusters about the entrance) to carry
on their labours instead of remaining in enforced idleness.</p>

<p>We often receive from Scotland magnificent boxes of
honey; the fine quality is no doubt to be attributed to
good pasturage, and to the fact of keeping the stocks
strong (see <a href="#Page_19">page 19</a>), by adopting the means before
hinted at; and thus having hives well stored and well
populated early in the season, so that they may betimes
take full advantage of supplies of nectar in the flowers.
Early honey is generally the best in colour.</p>

<p>The old proverb runs:&mdash;"It is the early bird that finds
the worm." The hive that is strong is certain to produce
the most honey. To make this plain, we will suppose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">- 118 -</span>
that a bee-keeper has a weakly hive; it will take some
weeks, if not months, to grow populous; and as soon as
the strength of the hive has recovered, the honey season
will have advanced, if not ended, whilst the strong
stocks have been able to take full advantage of the
supplies, having an abundance of labourers to collect the
honey and store it in supers for their master. To
induce the bees to build quickly, cover up the super with
as much warm woollen covering as you can, as recommended
for glasses, <a href="#Page_65">page 65</a>.</p>

<p>In fine seasons, and under good management, extra
supers and body boxes (the latter to be used as
"nadirs") maybe required to place above and below
the supers and nadirs partly filled, in order to reap the
full benefit of the honey season; for with strong colonies
one box after another may be inserted, till the whole
towers from six to ten boxes high. This plan is, indeed,
collecting honey while the sun shines, but requires a
greater amount of apiarian skill and good pasturage to
carry on in its entirety than is generally possessed. In
other words, we in the south may find it difficult to rival
our accomplished brother-apiarians north of the Tweed,
for they do wonders with the Stewarton hive.</p>


<h3 id="HUBERS_HIVE">HUBER'S HIVE.</h3>

<p>To Francis Huber&mdash;not improperly styled the "Prince
of Apiarians"&mdash;we are indebted for more extensive and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">- 119 -</span>
accurate observations on the habits of the bee than have
been contributed by all other observers since the time of
Aristotle.</p>

<p>During the early period of Huber's investigations, he
prosecuted them by means of single-comb hives, which
allow of each side of the comb being examined. He
found, however, that there was one important defect.
The bees could not in these hives cluster together, which
is their natural method of withstanding the effects of a
reduced temperature. Huber hit upon the ingenious expedient
of combining a number of single-comb frames,
so as to form one complete hive, which could be opened,
in order to expose any particular comb, without disturbing
the rest. From the manner of the opening and
closing of this hive, it has generally been called the
"Leaf or Book Hive." The division separating each
comb is joined both back and front with "butt hinges,"
fastened with a movable pin, on withdrawing which, at
either side, each comb and the bees on it may be inspected
as easily as if in a single-comb hive. Huber's
leaf hive is thus in appearance, as if several ordinary
"History of England" backgammon chess-boards were
set up on end together. The floor-board on which the
hive stands is larger than the hive when closed, so as to
allow of its being opened freely at any particular
"volume." An entrance-way for the bees is hollowed-out
of the floor-board as in other hives. There is a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">- 120 -</span>
glass window in each end of the hive, which is provided
with a shutter.</p>

<p>There is, however, one serious objection to Huber's
hive, which, though not noticed by him or his careful
assistant, has prevented its general use&mdash;that is, the
difficulty there is in closing it without crushing some of
the bees&mdash;a catastrophe which, by exasperating their
comrades, is certain to interfere with any experiments.
There is no such risk in the bar and frame hive, whilst
in it every facility possessed by Huber's is retained; so
that we strongly recommend scientific apiarians to use
some kind of bar and frame hive in preference to
Huber's. We have here introduced a description of
Huber's leaf hive (and should be glad to exhibit one)
for the sake of its historic interest, in connection with
apiarian science. The invention was invaluable for
Huber himself, and it suggested to other apiarians the
adoption of the present plan of vertical bars and frames.</p>

<p>The character of Huber and the circumstances under
which he pursued his observations are so remarkable,
that we need scarcely apologize for stating a few particulars
respecting him here. He was born at Geneva, in
July, 1750, his family being in honourable station and
noted for talent. Just as he attained to manhood he lost
his sight, and remained blind to the end of his days.
This apparently insuperable obstacle in the way of
scientific observation was overcome by the remarkable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">- 121 -</span>
fidelity with which Burnens, his assistant, watched the
bees and reported their movements to Huber. Madame
Huber also, who, betrothed to him before his calamity,
had remained constant in her affection, assisted in the
investigations with great assiduity during their long and
happy wedded life. We quote the following from
"Memoirs of Huber," by Professor de Candolle:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have seen the blind shine as poets, and distinguish
themselves as philosophers, musicians, and calculators;
but it was reserved for Huber to give a lustre to
his class in the sciences of observation, and on objects so
minute that the most clear-sighted observer can scarcely
perceive them. The reading of the works of Reaumur
and Bonnet, and the conversation of the latter, directed
his curiosity to the history of the bees. His habitual
residence in the country inspired him with the desire,
first of verifying some facts, then of filling some blanks
in their history; but this kind of observation required
not only the use of such an instrument as the optician
must furnish, but an intelligent assistant, who alone could
adjust it to its use. He had then a servant named
Francis Burnens, remarkable for his sagacity and for
the devotion he bore his master. Huber practised
him in the art of observation, directed him to his researches
by questions adroitly combined, and, aided by
the recollections of his youth and by the testimonies of
his wife and friends, he rectified the assertions of his
assistant, and became enabled to form in his own mind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">- 122 -</span>
a true and perfect image of the manifest facts. 'I am
much more certain,' said he, smiling, to a scientific
friend, 'of what I state than you are, for you publish
what your own eyes only have seen, while I take the
mean among many witnesses.' This is, doubtless, very
plausible reasoning, but very few persons will by it be
rendered distrustful of their own eyesight."</p>

<p>The results of Huber's observations were published
in 1792, in the form of letters to Ch. Bonnet, under the
title of "Nouvelles Observations sur les Abeilles." This
work made a strong impression upon many naturalists,
not only because of the novelty of the facts stated and
the excellent inductive reasoning employed, but also on
account of the rigorous accuracy of the observations
recorded, when it was considered with what an extraordinary
difficulty the author had to struggle.</p>

<p>Huber retained the clear faculties of his observant
mind until his death, which took place on the 22nd of
December, 1831. Most of the facts relating to the
impregnation of the queen, the formation of cells, and
the whole economy of the bee-community, as discovered
and described by Huber, have received full confirmation
from the investigations of succeeding naturalists.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">- 124 -</span>
view; then, by raising the upper hive or cover, the
glasses may be deliberately inspected without molestation
from the bees, and the progress made by the busy multitude
in building and filling their combs may be watched
by the bee-keeper, from day to day, with great and increasing
interest. Under the roof on each side are
openings to act as ventilators, to allow the heated air to
escape. With the sun shining on the house and no
escape of this kind, the heat would be retained inside,
and the temperature become that of an oven.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="page124" style="width: 379px;">
  <img src="images/page124.png" width="379" height="284" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Here our engraving shows the back view of the bee-house,
the interior being furnished with two of our improved
cottage hives. Two suspended weights will be
noticed; these are to balance the top hives which cover
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">- 125 -</span>
the glasses; the cord for each runs on pulleys, so that
the covers can be easily raised and as easily shut down
again when the inspection is finished. We may here
remark, that it is not well to keep the glasses long exposed
to full light and view.</p>

<p>The front of the bee-house being closely boarded, a
passage-way is contrived for the bees, by which they
have egress and ingress, without being able to gain
access to the house. The hives must be kept close to
the front boarding of the house, to prevent the opening
of any crevices which the bees might mistake for the
entrance to their hives, and so find their way into
the house. The front view of this bee-house shows
the ordinary contrivance for entrance; the sliding zinc
entrances may also be advantageously fixed, as shown
in the engraving of a bee-house to contain twelve hives.
In many parts of the country, hives and honey are sometimes
stolen from the garden; the bee-houses we furnish
have a lock and key to prevent depredations of this
kind.</p>

<p>Care must be taken to keep the bee-houses free from
spiders and other insects. In some districts, ants are
numerous and troublesome. The plan we recommend
for excluding them is to put some pitch round the four
supports of the bee-house, or, better still, strips of loose
flannel, or other woollen material that is absorbent,
which have previously been soaked in lamp oil. We
use sperm oil, as being the slowest-drying oil we know
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">- 126 -</span>
of. A piece of string will keep the flannel close to the
wood and then neither ant nor other insect will pass up;
so that Dy this simple means the hives may, so to speak,
be insulated, and placed beyond their reach. As the oil
dries up, it can easily be renewed. We have found this
an effectual remedy against these insidious enemies
of bees.</p>

<p>Where economy of room is a consideration, we fit up
bee-houses with a double row of hives, one above the
other. Our engravings show the back and front of a
house of this kind, having an ornamental zinc gutter to
prevent the wet from dripping on to the alighting-board.</p>

<p>When a number of hives are thus together, we colour
the alighting-boards differently, so that the bees may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">- 127 -</span>
have a distinctive mark by which each may know its
own home, and not wander into its neighbour's house.
Bees readily enough receive a honey-laden labourer into
a hive; but if the wanderer be poor and empty, he will
be promptly repulsed, and may have to forfeit his life
for his mistake. Queens returning from their wedding
trip are liable to mistake their hive if all the entrances
are so much alike that a noticeable difference is not
easily apparent. A queen entering a hive already supplied
with a fruitful sovereign would be certain to be
killed. The loss to the hive to which the queen belonged
is a serious one. Hives are often made queenless from
this cause, and thereby reduced to utter ruin, the bee-master
perhaps attributing his failure to something altogether
different.</p>

<p>This engraving represents a bee-house adapted for
having a number of hives in a limited space,&mdash;three
rows of hives, one above the other.</p>

<p>We do not recommend a bee-house of this construction;
it is difficult to erect one to afford space for
super hives, without its being so inconveniently high
as to be liable to be blown over by strong winds.</p>

<p>Hives thus located in a bee-house are not exposed to
so much change of temperature, and the stocks generally
pass the winter well.</p>

<p>Here we may introduce the meditations of a German
apiarian, who describes the advantages of a bee-house
for the bees, and his own pleasure in watching over his
pets in the winter, as they dwell so comfortably and
safely. It is true that Herr Braun associates still choicer
delights with the simple pleasures of bee-keeping, but

<p>The annexed engraving
of the Ornamental Zinc
Cover renders but little description
necessary. The
illustration shows one of our
improved cottage hives on
a stand. Three clumps of
wood must be driven into
the ground, and the three
iron rods supporting the
covering made fast to them
with screws; there are
screw holes in the feet of
the iron rods for the purpose.
When thus secured,
but little fear need be entertained
of its being blown
over by high winds.</p>

<p>In the roof two pulleys
are fixed, so that, by attaching a cord, the upper hive
covering the bell-glass supers may be raised with facility
for the purpose of observing the progress made by
the bees.</p>

<p>The ornamental zinc cover will form a pleasing object
in the flower-garden, when placed in a suitable position
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">- 132 -</span>
on the grass plot. It is painted green; the iron rods are
of such a length as to support the roof at a convenient
height from the ground.</p>

<p>This is a simple and inexpensive

<p>The late Mr. J. H. Payne, of Bury, author of the
"Bee-keeper's Guide" introduced another glass. It has
a three-inch hole in the centre, the purpose
of which is to tempt bees to produce
additional and larger stores of
honey. It is to be used as follows:&mdash;When
a bell glass is half or quite filled,
raise it, and place Payne's glass over the hole of the
stock-hive, with the filled glass on it, over the three-inch
hole. The bees will bring their combs through, and
thus Mr. Payne found that they would store more honey
than if the bell glass were removed and another empty
one put in its place. Of course, the first glass must be
smaller in diameter than Payne's glass, so as to rest
upon it.</p>


<h3 id="FLAT-TOPPED_GLASS">FLAT-TOPPED GLASS.</h3>

<p>This is a glass super, to be placed on the hive in a

has the advantages of being straight at the sides, flat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">- 135 -</span>
at top, and without a knob; so that when filled it
may be brought on to the breakfast
table, inverted, on a plate. The glass
lid shown in the engraving forms a
cover, and fits over outside, so as not
to interfere with the combs within.
These flat-top glasses, like those with a
knob, have a hole through which a zinc
ventilating tube is inserted. Dimensions, six and three-quarter
inches wide, five inches high.</p>

<h3 id="GUIDE_COMB">GUIDE-COMB FOR GLASSES.</h3>

<p>In some of our previous allusions to the best mode of
inducing bees to commence working in glasses, we have
recommended attaching guide-comb. We will now
more particularly explain how this attraction can be best
applied. We have already shown how bees may be
induced to make use of guide-combs fixed to bars, and
the same principle is applicable to glasses. These may
be filled, with great regularity, by adopting the following
directions, which, we believe, have never before
appeared in print:&mdash;</p>

<p>Procure a piece of clean new empty worker honey-comb,
which has not had honey in it (because honey will
prevent adhesion to the glass); cut it into pieces of about
three-quarters of an inch square. Gently warm the
exterior of the glass (this we find is best done by holding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">- 136 -</span>
the glass horizontally for a short time over the flame
of a candle); then apply one of the pieces of empty
comb inside at the part warmed, taking care, in fixing
it, that the pitch or inclination of the cells is upwards&mdash;in
fact, place the guide-comb in the same relative position
that it occupied in the hive or glass from which it
was taken. There is some danger of making the glass
too warm, which will cause the comb to melt and the
wax to run down the side, leaving an unsightly appearance
on the glass; this should be carefully avoided, and
a little experience will soon enable the operator to determine
the degree of warmth sufficient to make the comb
adhere without any of it being melted. It is hardly
necessary to state that only the very whitest combs
ought to be used. A short time should be allowed before
changing the position of the glass, so that it may cool
sufficiently to hold the comb in its place. Six or eight
pieces may thus be fixed, so that, when the glass is filled,
it will present a star shape, all the combs
radiating from the centre. The annexed
engraving shows the appearance of a
glass as worked by the bees, in which
guide-combs were fixed in the manner
described above. The drawing was taken from a glass
of our own filled after being thus furnished.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="page136" style="width: 101px;">
  <img src="images/page136.png" width="101" height="105" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In the Old Museum at the Royal Gardens, Kew,
may be seen a Taylor's glass, presented by us, some of
the combs in which are elongated on the outside to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">- 137 -</span>
the breadth of six inches. We believe, that not only does
a glass present a much handsomer appearance when
thus worked&mdash;and will, on that account, most fully
reward the trouble of fixing guide-comb&mdash;but that more
honey is stored in the same space, and in less time than
if the glass be placed on the hive merely in a naked
condition for the bees to follow their own devices.</p>

<p>This mode of fixing guide-comb does not solely apply
to the above-shaped glass, but is equally useful for all
kinds of glasses. It is introduced in connection with this
glass because, from its having a flat top and no knob,
the regularity is more clearly apparent.</p>

<p>The working of bees in the bell glasses illustrates
how tractable their disposition really is, if only scope be
allowed for the due exercise of their natural instinct.
They have no secrets in their economy, and they do not
shrink from our constant observation as they daily pursue
their simple policy of continuous thrift and persevering
accumulation. Yet it is only owing to the labours
of successive inventors that we are now enabled to
watch "the very pulse of the machine" of the bee-commonwealth:&mdash;</p>

<h3 id="BOTTLE_FEEDER">THE NEW BOTTLE-FEEDER.</h3>

<div class="figleft" id="page140" style="width: 95px;">
  <img src="images/page140.png" width="95" height="119" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It has long been acknowledged that the best mode of
feeding bees is through an opening at the top of the
stock-hive. The new bottle-feeder is a
simple and good means of administering
food when a stock requires help in that
way, as bees can take the food from it
without leaving the hive. Any kind of
hive that has an opening at the top may
thus be fed. Another important feature is the cleanliness
with which liberal feeding can be accomplished;
and few operations require more care than does feeding.
If liquid sweet is left hanging about the hive, it tempts
robber-bees; and when once the bees of an apiary have
had a taste, there is no knowing where their depredations
will stop: they resolutely attack and endeavour to
rob other hives, fighting and killing one another to a
considerable extent. Even if no hives be completely
destroyed, weakness from loss of numbers will be the
portion of most, if not of all, the hives in the garden.</p>

<p>The morals of our favourites are here a good deal at
fault, for the stronger hives, when their inordinate passion
is thus stirred up by the carelessness or want of knowledge
of the bee-keeper, attack and prey upon the weaker
ones. To be "forewarned is to be forearmed"&mdash;and
"prevention is better than cure." We strongly recommend
closely covering up the feeder; one of the middle-size
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">- 141 -</span>
bell glasses put over it makes a close-fitting cover, should
the regular cover to the hive not be sufficiently tight.
When bees are not kept in a bee-house, and are, on that
account, more accessible, this extra care is particularly
needed. The right time for feeding is in the autumn or
spring. As stated at <a href="#Page_76">page 76</a>, it is requisite to ascertain
the condition of the hive at Michaelmas, and, if wanting,
the deficiency can then be made up.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> It is not wise to defer
feeding until later in the season, because it is important
that, when the food is placed b the cells, the bees should
seal it up; and a tolerably warm temperature is required
to enable them to secrete the wax for the delicately-formed
lids of the cells. If the food remained unsealed,
there is danger of its turning sour, and thereby causing
disease among the bees. It is not well to feed in mid-winter
or when the weather is very cold: bees at such
times consume but little food, being in a state of torpor,
from which it is better not to arouse them.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> A much greater quantity of food will have to be administered
than the actual weight required to be furnished, because there is
a very considerable decrease after it is taken by the bees.</p>

</div>

<p>A little food in the spring stimulates the queen to lay
more abundantly, for bees are provident and do not
rear the young so rapidly when the supplies are short.
In this particular, the intelligence of bees is very
striking; they have needed no Malthus to teach them
that the means of subsistence must regulate the increase
of a prosperous population:&mdash;</p>

</p>
</div>

<p class="p0">Judgment has, however, to be exercised by the apiarian
in giving food, for it is quite possible to do <i>mischief by
over-feeding</i>. The bees, when over-fed, will fill so many
of the combs with honey, that the queen, in the early
spring, cannot find empty cells in which to deposit her
eggs, and, by this means, the progress of the hive is
much retarded,&mdash;a result that should be guarded against.
The following directions will show how the bottle-feeder
is to be used:&mdash;Fill the bottle with liquid food;
apply the net, affixed by an india-rubber band, over the
mouth; place the block over the hole of the stock-hive,
invert the bottle, the neck resting within the hole in the
block; the bees will put their tongues through the perforations
and imbibe the food, thus causing the bottle to
act on the principle of a fountain. The bottle being
glass, it is easy to see when the food is consumed. The
piece of perforated zinc is for the purpose of preventing
the bees from clinging to the net, or escaping from the
hive when the bottle is taken away for the purpose of
refilling. A very good syrup for bees may be made by
boiling 6 lbs. of honey with 2 lbs. of water, for a few
minutes; or loaf sugar, in the proportion of 3 lbs. to
2 lbs. of water, answers very well when honey is not
to be obtained.</p>

</div>

<p>Round bee-feeders are made of zinc and earthenware,
eight inches across, three inches deep. The projection
outside is a receptacle for
pouring in the food; the bees gain
access to the feeder through a
round hole, which is placed either
at the centre or nearer one side,
whichever may best suit the openings on the top of the
stock-hive. The feeder occupies a similar position to
that of the glasses or cap hives in the gathering season.
A circular piece of glass, cut so as to fit into a groove,
prevents the bees escaping, and retains the warmth
within the hive, whilst it affords opportunity for inspecting
the bees when feeding.</p>

<p>The feeders were originally only made of zinc; but
some bee-keepers advised the use of earthenware, and a
few have been made to meet the wishes of those who
give the preference to that material.</p>

<p>When the bees are fed from above in this manner,
the feeder is kept at a warm temperature by the heat of
the hive. In common hives, cottagers feed the bees by
pushing under the hive thin slips of wood scooped out,
into which the food is poured. This plan of feeding
can only be had recourse to at night, 'and the pieces of
wood must be removed in the morning. By feeding at
the top of the stock-hive any interruption of the bees is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">- 144 -</span>
avoided. For further instructions on this head, see the
directions given for using the bottle-feeder.</p>

<p>We have invented the fountain bee-feeder, in order
that a larger supply of liquid food might be given to a
hive than is practicable with the
round feeder.</p>

<p>The liquid honey is poured in at,
the opening, which unscrews; whilst
being filled, the inside slide, closing
the opening through which the food
passes into the feeding-pan, should be shut down. When
the reservoir is filled, the screw is made fast, and, the
slide being withdrawn, a wooden float, pierced with
small holes, through which the bees take the food, forms
a false bottom, and rises and falls with the liquid. This
feeder, being on the siphon principle, like a poultry or
bird water-fountain, is supplied from the reservoir until
that is empty. A piece of glass is fixed in the side of
the reservoir, in order that the bee-keeper may see
when it is emptied. A flat piece of glass on the top prevents
the bees from escaping, and through it they may be
inspected whilst feeding. The bees find access to the
feeder on to the perforated float through the central
round hole, which is placed over a corresponding hole
in the stock-hive.</p>

<p>Honey cutters are used for removing comb from boxes

<p>This fumigator is a tin box, somewhat like a pepper-box
upon a foot. It is a simple adaptation of the fumigating
apparatus described by Mr. Nutt, and
is used in the following manner:&mdash;Have a straw
hive or other vessel ready that will match in
circumference the hive intended to be fumigated.
If the empty hive have a conical top,
it will not remain crown downwards without a
rest; in this case, it will be convenient to
invert it on a pail. Having ascertained that the hive to
be operated upon and the empty one in its reversed position
nearly match in size, take half a packet of the prepared
fungus, fire it well, and place it in the box or
fumigator; place this in the centre of the empty hive,
then bring the occupied hive directly over, so as to
receive the fumes of smoke. To keep all close, put a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">- 146 -</span>
wet cloth round the place where the two hives meet.
In a minute or two, the bees may be heard dropping
heavily into the lower empty hive, where they lie stupefied.
After a little while, the old hive may be tapped
upon to make the bees fall more quickly. On removing;
the upper hive, the bees from it will be found lying quiet
at the bottom of the lower one. Place a sheet on the
ground, and spread the bees on it; then, with a feather,
sort them over, in order to pick out the queen-bee. As
soon as the queen is found, pour the rest of the
lethargic swarm from off the sheet back into the inverted
hive again. The stupefied bees must now be sprinkled
freely with a syrup made of honey and water, or sugar
and ale boiled together. Some' apiarians recommend a
few drops 'of peppermint to be mixed with the syrup, in
order to drown the peculiar odour which is special to
each hive of bees,&mdash;this is more necessary when two-hives
of bees are fumigated, and whilst under the influence
of smoke are well mixed together. The hive containing
the bees with which it is intended to unite the
stupefied bees must now be placed on the top of that
'containing the latter, just as the hive was from which
they have come. A wet cloth must be fastened round
the two hives, so as to prevent any of the bees from
escaping. The hives in this position must be placed
where they are not likely to be knocked down or
meddled with. The fresh bees in the upper hive,
attracted by the scent of the bees besmeared with honey,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">- 147 -</span>
go down and commence licking off the sweets from the
sleepy ones. The latter gradually revive, when all get
mingled together and ascend in company to the upper
hive, where they live as if they had not been separate
families. The two hives should be left undisturbed for
twenty-four hours, then the upper hive may be removed
and placed immediately on the spot from whence it was
brought.</p>

<p>The reason the queen is recommended to be taken is
to prevent any fighting. She should be kept alive and
fed as long as she will live, in case any harm should
befall the sovereign of the other community.</p>

<p>The tube fumigator<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> is useful for several purposes.
When a frame-hive has to be disturbed it is requisite
to raise the lid and blow a little
smoke into the hive, so as to check
the angry passions of the bees.
If it be desirable to stupefy the bees, ignited fungus must
be placed in the box and the flattened end applied to
the entrance of the hive; the smoke is then blown in,
either with bellows or by applying the mouth of the
operator, taking care to close all openings through
which it can escape. The bees fall down stupefied,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">- 148 -</span>
generally in about ten minutes; but the effect varies
according to the populousness of the hive and the quantity
of comb in it. The projected operations must now
be performed speedily, as activity will soon be regained.
See preceding directions.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>All operations connected with the removal or the
hiving of bees should be conducted with calmness
and circumspection. Bees, although the
busiest of creatures, entertain a great
dislike to fussiness in their masters, and
become irritable at once if the apiarian
allows them to see that he is in a hurry.
Hence, there is great advantage in having
the face and hands covered whilst at work
amongst the bees; for when the operator
knows he cannot possibly be stung, he
can open his hives, take out the combs, gather in his
swarms, or take the honey, with all the deliberation of
a philosopher. Various kinds of bee-dresses have been
contrived; one that we keep ready in stock is of a very
simple construction. It is made of strong <i>black net</i>, in
shape like an inverted bag, large enough to allow of a
gentleman's wide-awake or a lady's hat being worn
underneath. The projection of the hat or cap causes
the dress to stand off from the face, and the meshes, of
the net, though much too small for a bee to penetrate,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">- 149 -</span>
are wide enough to allow of clear vision for the operator.
An elastic band secures the dress round the waist; the
sleeves also, made of durable black calico, are secured
at the wrists by a similar method. The hands of the
bee-master may be effectually protected with a pair of
india-rubber gloves, which should be put on before the
dress is fastened round the wrists. This kind of glove
is regularly used by photographers, and allows of
greater ease in manipulation than any other description.</p>

<p>Thus a very simple and inexpensive means of protection
will enable even a novice in bee-keeping to
make his observations and conduct his experiments
under a sense of perfect security. Still, he need not be
careless as to the feelings of his bees; his success and
their comfort will be promoted by his "handling them
gently, and as if he loved them." "Familiarity" between
bees and their master "breeds" not "contempt,"
but affection.</p>

<p>Any sudden or clumsy movement, which jars the
combs or frames, will excite the bees, and if but one
should be crushed, the odour of their slaughtered comrade
rouses the inhabitants of the hive to a pitch of
exasperation. Their powers of smelling are very acute.
The human breath is abomination to them; therefore,
when operating upon bees, be careful to close the mouth
and breathe only through the nostrils. The best time
for most operations is in the middle of a fine day.</p>

GUIDANCE OF BEES IN THE CONSTRUCTION
OF HONEY-COMB ON THE BARS.</h3>

<p>This is an engraved metal roller, which, when applied
to the coated underside of a comb-bar, leaves an impression
as shown in the diagram. The wax having
been spread on the flat bar, the roller, heated by being
put into hot water, is heavily pressed over it. The
roller has two wooden handles, so that considerable
pressure may be given to it. The roller is a little less
than two inches in diameter, seven-eighths of an inch
wide, and the length from handle to handle is six inches.
The diagram shows the full size of the impressions as
left on the wax, after passing the roller along the comb-bar,
in the manner above described. It is a contrivance
invented in Switzerland, and exhibited in the
International Exhibition of 1862, when the pattern
roller was purchased by ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">- 151 -</span></p>

<p>The bars of a hive prepared with these markings in
wax afford ready-made foundations for regular combs,
which very much facilitate the operations of the bees.</p>


<h3 id="IMPRESSED_SHEETS">IMPRESSED WAX SHEETS FOR ARTIFICIAL
COMBS.</h3>

<p>These artificial partition walls for combs are sheets
of genuine wax, about the substance of thin cardboard.
They receive rhomboidal impressions by being pressed
between two metal plates, carefully and mathematically
prepared and cast so that the impressions are exactly
the same size as the base of the cells of a honey-comb.
An inspection of a piece of comb will show that the
division of the opposite cells is made by a thin partition
wall, common to both. Now the substance of this is said
to be only the one hundred and eightieth part of an inch,
whilst the artificial ones we are recommending are
between the thirtieth and fortieth part of an inch, more
than four times the thickness of the handiwork of the
bees themselves. It would, indeed, be vain to attempt
to furnish sheets of wax at all approaching their own
delicate fabric; the impressed sheets are quite as thin
as they can be to bear the handling which is requisite
for fixing them in the hives. We find, however, that
the thickness is no disadvantage; the bees speedily excavate
and <i>pare the artificial sheet</i> so as to suit their own
notions of the substance required; then, with admirable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">- 152 -</span>
economy, they use the surplus thus obtained for the construction
of the cells. After a sheet has been partly
worked at by the bees, it is interesting to hold it up to
the light and observe the beautiful transparency of that
part of it, contrasted with the opaqueness of the part not
yet laboured upon.</p>

<p>When it is considered, as writers tell us, that more
than 14 lbs. of honey are required for the secretion and
elaboration of a single pound of comb, it will not be
difficult to form a just estimate of the value of this invention,
which thus furnishes cheap and excellent assistance
to our industrious favourites. It also shows the bee-keeper
that all clean empty combs should be carefully
preserved and considered as valuable stock. Another
great advantage that it affords us is, that it renders us
independent of <i>guide-comb</i>, which is not always obtainable.
When a sheet or a strip of this impressed wax
is properly fixed to the comb-bar, it is <i>certain</i> to be the
guide and foundation of a straight comb. This invention
has been derived from Germany, where it has been
adopted many years with success. At the International
Exhibition of 1862, we purchased the metal plates or
castings, so as to manufacture the impressed sheets with
which we are now able to supply our customers; and,
after the careful trials we have made, we have great
confidence in recommending them.</p>

<p>In the season of 1863 we furnished a Woodbury glass
super, with the wax sheets fixed to the bars, in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">- 153 -</span>
manner hereafter to be explained, and it was truly
astonishing to see the rapidity with which these sheets of
wax were worked into comb. Receptacles were quickly
made ready for the storing of honey, and the new combs
soon became beautifully white; for, although the artificial
wax has a yellow tinge, yet, after being worked at
and made thinner, it is as good in colour as ordinary
combs. For supers we cut the wax plates in half,
making one serve for two bars.</p>

<p>We have received from Germany the following directions
for the fastening of the artificial plates to the comb-bars.
Hereafter will be described a plan which we have
adopted, and to which preference is given.</p>

<p>(<i>Translation.</i>)&mdash;"The unstamped edge of the plate
receives incisions half an inch distant from one another,
made with a sharp knife, the plate having been a little
warmed; then it is pinched between two equally strong
ledges, which have been well moistened. The projecting
edge of the plate which received the incisions is alternately
bent to the right and to the left. The comb-bar
is well besmeared with artificial sticking wax (a mixture
of two parts of wax and one part of American
resin), and is well warmed at a fire. Afterwards the
besmeared side is laid upon the bent end of the plate,
and pressed to it as firmly as possible. A small wooden
ledge, besmeared with sticking wax, and fastened by
means of pressure to the lower edge of the plate, prevents
it from bending, which sometimes happens when
the bees work it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">- 154 -</span></p>

<p>To carry out the directions here given, it is necessary
to warm the besmeared comb-bar at a fire; the wax plate
has also to be warmed. Having tried this plan, and
found inconvenience attending it, especially from the wax
curling with the heat and the difficulty of making it stick
firm, to say nothing of the uncomfortableness of performing
the operation before a fire on a hot day in July,
we began to consider if a little carpentering might not do
the work better and more pleasantly, and adopted the
following plan:&mdash;We split or cut the comb-bars of the
Woodbury super in half, lengthways, and, taking the unstamped
edge between the two strips, joined them together
again by small screws at the side, confining the wax
plate tightly in the centre, with no possibility of its falling
down. Where frames are used, of course the bar could
not be cut in two (except with the "compound bar and
frame," where the bar being loose, it might be as easily
managed). The plan we adopt with an ordinary frame
is to saw out an opening, about an inch or an inch and
a half from either end, where the sides are morticed
in; this opening we make with a keyhole-saw. Through
it the wax plate is easily put, and, with a heated iron
passed over the upper side of the bar, is made sufficiently
firm. If the wax plates are too large, a portion may
be cut off; an opening of full eleven inches long can be
made without materially weakening the bar and frame.</p>

<p>Another, and perhaps the simplest, plan is, to fix a
strip of wood with brads to the underside of the top
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">- 155 -</span>
frame or bar: place the wax sheet against this, then
wedge another strip close to it, and thus hold the
wax sheet firmly in the centre of the frame, taking
care also to make the second strip of wood fast with
brads.</p>

<p>The wax plates must not extend to the bottom of the
frame; a space of at least one inch should be left for
expansion, because the bees, in working the plate,
stretch it down lower. We also use a few pins firmly
pressed into the frames, and long enough to reach the
edge of the plate; for by fixing three or four pins on
either side, both at the sides and at the bottom, the
plate may be held in an exactly central position within
the frame. As before mentioned, when these directions
are carried out, there is no fear of being troubled with
crooked combs or bars.</p>

<p>The secretion of wax, and the method of its adaptation
by the bees, is thus admirably described by Evans:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p0">AVING, at <a href="#Page_84">page 84</a>, given a description of the mechanical
arrangements of bar and frame hives,
the next thing is, to describe the mode of introducing the
bees, and of thus bringing the humane and scientific hives
into operation. The swarm should be first hived into a
common straw hive from the bough or shrub upon which
they may have alighted; place this hive, into which we
will suppose the bees have been shaken, on the ground,
propped up on one side with a brick or a flower-pot,
or anything of the sort that may be handy, in order that
straggler-bees may join the swarm. The spot selected
for this should be as shady an one as can be found, near
to the place where the swarm settled; or it may be
shaded from the rays of the sun by fixing matting on two
poles, so as to prevent the heat falling on the hive;
spread a sheet or cloth on the ground where an even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">- 158 -</span>
surface can be obtained; stake this sheet down at the
four corners, to prevent ruts and inequalities, which are
great hindrances to the bees going into the bar and frame
hive; place the latter upon the sheet, without its floor-board,
having its front raised on blocks or sticks rather
more than an inch,&mdash;not more, otherwise the bees will
cluster, and attach themselves to the lower part of the
frames, instead of going up between. These preparations
will, perhaps, occupy ten minutes, by which time
the swarm will have become settled and tolerably quiet.
Then, with a sharp rap, precipitate the bees out of the
straw hive on to the sheet immediately in front of the
frame hive; give the straw hive another knock, so as to
dislodge all the bees, and then take it quite away, otherwise
they may, if it be left near, perversely choose to go
into that, instead of the one desired. In some cases,
as when the swarm has to be brought from a distance
and procured from a cottager about whose skill in carrying
out these directions there may be misgivings, it is
best to give instructions that the swarm be brought
home after sunset, and then the foregoing directions
for inducing the bees to tenant the frame hive may be
better carried out. For ourselves, we much prefer the
evening for the purpose. A little water sprinkled over
them from a watering-pot is likely to induce the bees to
quit the ground and go up into the hive more quickly.</p>

<p>Mr. Langstroth, in his admirable book, "The Hive
and Honey Bee," writes:&mdash;"If they are too dilatory in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">- 159 -</span>
entering the new hive, they may be gently separated
with a spoon or leafy twig where they gather in
bunches on the sheet, or they may be carefully 'spooned
up' and shaken out close to the front of the hive.
As these go in with fanning wings, they will raise a
peculiar note, which communicates to their companions
that they have found a home, and in a short time the
whole swarm will enter, without injury to a single bee."
In the <i>Journal of Horticulture</i>, Mr. Woodbury says:&mdash;"If
combs be fixed in the frames, the crown-board may
be removed and the cluster knocked out of the straw
hive on to the top of the exposed frames. The bees
will disappear between them with the utmost alacrity,
delighted to have met with a ready-furnished dwelling,
and the top, or crown-board, having been replaced, the
hive should at once be removed to the position it is intended
to permanently occupy."</p>

<p>No one should attempt these operations without being
protected by a bee dress and a pair of india-rubber
gloves, which are sting-proof. Some persons also take
the precaution of tying strings round the ancles of the
trousers, lest some straggler should determine to attack
the outposts of the enemy, which, to say the least, might
perplex the operator in the midst of his task. Elastic
india-rubber bands are good for this purpose, or a pair
of "knickerbockers" would be useful. If Wellington
boots are worn, the trousers may be tucked within the
leather, in which case no bee can molest the operator,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">- 160 -</span>
and no string or band will be needed. Practice makes
perfect in bee-tending, as in other matters, and when a
light hand is gained, there is little danger of the apiarian
being stung.</p>

<p>If the weather be wet the next day or so after hiving,
it will be well to give a little assistance to the new
colony in the shape of food, for although, when a swarm
leaves a hive, almost every bee composing it fills itself
with honey, we have known not a few instances, in case
of very wet weather, in which the whole swarm has
been starved for the want of this little timely help. Of
course, the first work of the bees is to build themselves
combs, and these combs being produced by the secretion
of wax from honey, a great drain upon their
resources immediately begins, and any little outlay at
this juncture is abundantly compensated by its enabling
these industrious emigrants the more quickly to push
forward the furnishing of their new home.</p>

<p>Clean combs from hives that may have lost their bees
are readily accepted, and cause a great saving in time
and; material to the bees; these combs may easily be
fixed by cutting them the proper size to fit within the
frames, and making them firm by tying with tape or
fixing them with pliable wire. In any case where the
combs are too small to fit within the frame, a temporary
bar may be fixed, and held firm by being sprung
within the two upright sides of a frame, and thus pushed
up until it presses the comb; then a piece of tape wound
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">- 161 -</span>
round, or a clip made of tin or zinc shaped to the top bar,
prevents its falling out. All these supports may be
removed<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> as soon as the bees have made the foundation
secure; the comb will then be added to. In this way,
every loose piece of comb may be economised.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> They should be first dismembered from the comb by running
a penknife between.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> Artificial comb may be advantageously used, especially if a
little time (say a couple of days) be allowed to elapse before it is
put into the hive; because, at first, so eager is a swarm to push
forward the work of comb-building, that the sheets are liable to
become mutilated. For guide-comb, cut the sheets in strips of
rather more than an inch in depth, and fix them as mentioned at
<a href="#Page_154">page 154</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>These preparations must be made prior to 'the bees
being hived, so that when a hive is so prepared, a
swarm may begin to adapt whatever advantages they
find ready for them; and it is truly marvellous what a
swarm will do when thus furnished with combs in their
new habitation. In these the queen can immediately
begin to deposit her eggs, and the workers to store
their honey, without having to wait for the construction
of combs, which is a laborious occupation for the bees.</p>

<p>In some cases, fine white combs of honey may be
taken from the stock-hive; the end frames are always
the most free from brood. Care must be exercised not
to rob this part of the hive too much; one comb may,
perhaps, be removed in the course of the season without
impoverishing the bees, but it is not wise to take more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">- 162 -</span></p>


<h3 id="PUTTING_ON_SUPER">PUTTING ON SUPER HIVE.</h3>

<p>A colony established a year or more is called a
"stock," by way of distinction from a swarm of the
present year. Supposing the hive to be a stock,
the super should be given them at the early part of
the season, say, if fine and warm, at the latter end of
April or beginning of May; if the weather be then
unfavourable, it is better to delay doing so until a more
genial temperature. If the colony be a swarm of the
present year, two weeks should be allowed to elapse from
the time of tenanting a hive, before putting on the super;
this delay is necessary to give the bees the opportunity of
building combs in their new domicile, and of getting a
store of honey for themselves before working for their
master.</p>

<p>When it is wished to use a super, <i>the crown-board or
roof of the stock-hive must be taken away, the thin adapting
or honey-board taking its place</i>. The two long slits at the
sides are to give admission to the super. The bees will
begin sooner, and work faster, if the eight bars are
each furnished with artificial comb (as described at
<a href="#Page_152">page 152</a>). We have had depriving-hives very quickly
filled when the bees were thus assisted. Combs that
have been left unfilled may be fixed to the bars as before
described; these must be white and clean, as dark comb
should not be used for super hives. The combs, when
filled, may be taken out singly, if desired for consumption,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">- 163 -</span>
substituting an empty bar or comb; or, should the
bee-keeper desire to see a handsome super, he must
wait until the bees have filled and sealed up all the
combs, and then he may proceed to disconnect the
super by drawing a string or wire <i>between the adapting-board
and the stock-hive</i>. After waiting a short time for
the commotion to subside, the operator must raise the
super on its board and blow in a little smoke. The bees
may be induced to quit by adopting either of the means
described at pages <a href="#Page_58">58</a> and <a href="#Page_73">73</a>. When the super has
been removed, another may be put on; but if the
honey-gathering be over, the crown-board should be
replaced.</p>


<h3 id="TAKING_OUT_FRAMES">TAKING OUT FRAMES WITH COMBS.</h3>

<p>It is well for a beginner to practise the directions for
opening and shutting up hives, by using an empty hive
until he becomes familiar with the handling of the frames.</p>

<p>The first thing to do is, to loosen the crown-board, or
lid, with a knife, drawing a piece of string underneath
it, to divide the wax or cement with which the bees make
all secure. This string should be drawn through very
slowly, so as not to irritate the bees. In hot weather,
the crown-board may be loosened by a lateral movement;
but sometimes, for want of care, this loosening
of the lid disturbs the bees, and, as soon as it
is removed, a number of them, enraged thereby, rush
out and attack the operator. This and all other operations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">- 164 -</span>
ought to be performed very carefully and gently.
Especial care should be taken not to prise the lid
upwards, by way of wrenching it off, for the frames
and combs are generally secured thereto, and there is
a liability of rending the combs with it; this will greatly
irritate the bees, and be otherwise injurious. When a
hive of bees is enraged, there is little chance of pacifying
them; it is best, under such circumstances, to "give
in," at once, and not attempt to perform any operation,
but to shut the hive up and beat a retreat, benefiting by
the experience, in order to do better a day or so afterwards.
There are various devices for intimidating or
conciliating the bees, and one of these already spoken of
is&mdash;smoke. So next time the experimenter makes his
attempt let him raise the lid an inch or so, and blow a
few puffs of smoke into the hive, which will cause the
bees to retreat This is best done by using our tube
fumigator, with a little of the prepared fungus lighted.
Pipes or cigars are not convenient to use for this purpose
when the head is enveloped in the dress. As soon as
the lid is removed, a few bees will fly out to learn the
cause of such an interference. Conciliation should then
be offered by having at hand a little, sweetened water,
which may be sprinkled, or rather let drop, from a
feather or a brush. The sudden motion of the hand
required in the act of sprinkling irritates the bees, so
that, instead of making them our friends, they may
become our foes. Mr. Langstroth recommends that a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">- 165 -</span>
fine watering-pot, filled with sweetened water, be used
for the purpose. Care must be taken not to drench the
bees; only just sufficient should be given to run down the
sides of the combs, as well as sprinkling the top. As
soon as the bees really understand that syrup is being
given them, they feast upon it, instead of angrily attacking
the operator. Thus pacified, and with gentle treatment,
but little difficulty will be found in proceeding with
the work required. But the unskilled operator should on
no account neglect to put on a bee-dress and gloves, as
described above. We would err on the side of caution,
although there is an old saying that "a cat in gloves
catches no mice;" and the apiarian will find that his
fingers are not so free to work as he would like, for
gloves, make them rather clumsy in drawing up the
frames.</p>

<p>The frames must now be gently prised from front to
rear; this may be done with a small screw-driver or
other stout instrument with a wedged end to go into the
notches. The frames fit loosely so as to allow of a little
movement from back to front; a lateral or side-way
movement might kill the queen, or, if not so fatal as
that, might crush some of the bees and injure the brood
combs, which must be carefully avoided. Of course, much
depends upon the nature of the operation that has to be
performed, whether or no all the frames should be thus
loosened. If it be for making artificial swarms, or for any
purpose requiring an interview with her majesty, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">- 166 -</span>
whole of them must be loosened, because it often happens
that all the combs have to be examined, sometimes twice
over, before she can be discovered. Bees are very apt
to build their combs in a slightly waving form, and in
extracting one it will be needful to make room both for
the comb and bees upon it to pass without scraping
the next comb, and there will be a difficulty if the
apiarian attempts to draw out one comb whilst the other
frames are located in their appropriate notches. Let the
operator gently proceed to lift, say, the third frame
(allowing it to lodge on the little block that divides the
notches) slightly nearer to the fourth frame, and the
second nearer the third, so as to admit of sufficient space
to lift out the end one. Very carefully and slowly he
should lift the frame by taking hold, with thumb and
finger, of the projecting shoulders that rest in the notch;
and he must not let it touch or scrape the next frame or
the sides of the hive, so as to crush or irritate any bees.</p>

<p>After the end comb is thus removed, it will be easy to
extract the others, as there will now be plenty of room
for drawing them out. A hive of exactly the same size
should be at hand; and in case it be desired to remove
the combs and bees into another hive, care should be
taken that each comb occupies the same relative position
that it did in the old hive.</p>

<p>In handling the frames, it should be borne in mind that
they are to be held perpendicularly. To gain a view
of both sides of the comb when searching for the queen,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">- 167 -</span>
or for any purpose requiring full inspection, with a little
dexterity in twirling the frame round, the reverse side may
be brought to face the operator, without letting the comb
break away by its own weight, and so fall out of the
frame, which it will do if allowed to deviate from its
upright or downright position. If the operator could
see an experienced person perform the operation,
he would quickly understand how combs may thus be
handled without any risk of a smash.</p>

<p>When placing frames in the hive, care must be taken
not to crush a bee between the projecting shoulders
of the frame and the rabbets or notches on which they
rest, and on no account must the frame be let down with
a jerk, or the bees will become exceedingly fierce: the
frame should be so slowly deposited in its place that a
bee on feeling the slightest pressure may have the opportunity
of escaping unhurt thereby. The crown-board
should be replaced by first resting its front edge in its
place, and then slowly lowering the after part, looking
carefully under, and momentarily raising it when necessary
to avoid crushing a bee. Should the hive have its
super on, the same directions may be followed. The
super with its honey-board may be bodily taken away,
and so placed and confined for a time that robber-bees
cannot find an entrance, and also be far enough from
the apiarian to be out of danger of being broken or
overturned by him.</p>

<h3 id="ADVANTAGES">ADVANTAGES OF BAR AND FRAME HIVES.</h3>

<p>It will be asked, Why all this trouble about bar and
frames with straight combs built upon them? We have
shown the full command which the bee-keeper has over a
hive so constituted, and we now proceed to show how, in
skilful hands, these advantages may be used successfully;
though; in the hands of the unpractised and unskilful, the
contrary may be the result.</p>

<p>All the bars and frames in an apiary ought to be of
precisely the same dimensions, so as to fit every hive.
This is essential for the strengthening of weak hives.
A hive that is weakly may often be advantageously
strengthened by having put into it a comb of brood
from a populous stock, to which an empty frame from
the weak one may be given; no bees must be on the
brood-comb&mdash;these should be shaken off or gently dislodged
with a feather into the hive from which the comb
is taken. The frames of combs should then be, one by
one, placed so as to fill' in the vacancy, leaving the empty
frame nearest the side. When a hive has been in use
many years, the combs become very black, and every bee
that is bred in a cell leaves a film behind. It may be
understood how in this way the cells become contracted,
and the bees that are bred in them correspondingly reduced
in size. After the lapse of at least, say, five years,
it may be necessary to begin removing the old combs.
This may be done by cutting away the comb, or by substituting;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">- 169 -</span>
an empty frame for one with old black comb,
gradually moving the frames towards each other. By
taking two away in this manner in the spring or summer
of every season, the combs in course of five years may
all be reconstructed, and fresh clean ones be secured
for breeding in, instead of the old black ones that otherwise
would remain as long as the stock could live in the
hive.</p>


<h3 id="ART_SWARMING">ARTIFICIAL SWARMING.</h3>

<p>Every bee-keeper knows the anxiety he feels in watching
and expecting a swarm to come forth, fearful lest
his favourites should, "like riches, take wing and fly
away,"&mdash;a mischance that it is desirable to prevent. In
our description of natural swarming, this will be found
fully treated of; we propose here merely to point out
how, with the movable frames, this work of Nature
may be assisted&mdash;we say assisted, because artificial
swarming should, as nearly as possible, resemble natural
swarming; that is, it should be performed at the same
time of the year, and when the populous state of the
hive makes a division desirable. This is easily known
to be the case when bees hang out in clusters at the
entrance, wasting their time in enforced idleness instead
of being abroad gathering honey. It is also necessary
that the hive contain drones.</p>

<p>When such, is, the state of the hive, the facility of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">- 170 -</span>
affording an artificial swarm with a movable frame-hive
is a decided advantage. The best time for performing
the operation is about ten o'clock in the morning
of a fine summer's day. The following directions
should be carried out:&mdash;Place ready a counter or bench
that is firm and strong, and which has space on it
for the inhabited&mdash;or, rather, the over-inhabited&mdash;frame-hive
and the empty one, which is about to be made the
receptacle of a separate stock. The operator, attired
in his bee-dress, and having the other appliances ready,
may now open the hive<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> as before described, and proceed
to take out the frames, carefully examining both
sides of each comb to find the queen;<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> she is generally
in the centre of the hive, so that it is not always needful
to take out all the ten frames. As they are examined,
the frames may be put into the empty hive, and when
the object of the bee-master's search is found, he must
carefully remove the frame containing her majesty, and
may place it temporarily in the empty hive, at one end
by itself. Next he must proceed to put the frames back
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">- 171 -</span>
into the old hive, closing up the vacancy caused by the
removal of the comb with the queen on it, and leave the
empty frame at the end. Then he may place the frame
containing the queen, with the few bees that maybe upon
it, in the centre of the empty hive; and, finally, putting
all the other frames in, and replacing the lid, the bee-master
will place this hive in the exact position occupied
by the old stock. The bees that are on the wing will go
to the old spot, and, finding the queen there, they will
rally round her, and very soon form a sufficient number
to constitute a swarm; comb-building will at once begin,
the frames will, in a week or so, be filled, and a satisfactory
stock will thus be established. By doing this, at
the right time, just before the bees are about to swarm,
or when there are many drones, all the trouble of
watching and waiting for them is saved. Mr. Woodbury
claims the honour of having originated this mode of
swarming.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> Bees are apt to take the interference more kindly if the stock
be moved a little distance from its accustomed stand; in such case,
place an empty hive in its place, to amuse returning bees. These
can be shaken out when the hive it is desired they should inhabit
is restored. If the hive be kept in a closed bee-house, the entrance
should be shut down until the hive is replaced, when the
clustered bees may be at once admitted.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">[18]</a> Italian queens are more easily detected, being of a brighter
colour and, generally, larger than English queens.</p>

</div>

<p>This operation we performed, exactly as described
above, with one of our improved cottage-hives, one afternoon
at the latter end of May, 1862. Whilst inspecting
our bees, we caught sight of the queen on the comb
in one of the bell-glasses. This was a chance not to be
missed, and we immediately resolved to form an artificial
swarm, for the hive was very full of bees. Besides, being
obliged to be away from the apiary most of the week,
we were glad of the opportunity of so easily establishing
a colony without the uncertainty and trouble of hiving a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">- 172 -</span>
natural swarm. In the first place, we slid a tin under
the bell-glass, and removing the stock-hive from underneath,
we took it a few feet away; then we placed an
empty improved cottage-hive where the old stock had
stood, and put the glass of comb containing the queen
and a few bees over one of the holes in the crown of this
new empty hive. The bees that were left abroad
belonging to the old stock returned as usual to their old
entrance as they supposed; soon a sufficient number
formed a large cluster in the hive and began comb-building,
the queen remaining in the glass until the
cells below were sufficiently numerous for her to deposit
her eggs in them. The division answered exceedingly
well; both hives prospered: the old hive either had some
princesses coming forward to supply the loss of the
queen, or the bees used a power that they possess of
raising a queen from worker-brood in the manner we
have previously described.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> See Section I, <a href="#Page_9">page 9</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>The foregoing account illustrates the successful formation
of an artificial swarm; but, with a cottage-hive,
gaining possession of the queen is quite a matter of
chance. With a movable frame-hive she can at any
suitable time be found.</p>

<p>Precisely the same plan is to be adopted with the old
stock in the frame-hive as we have described in the case
of the cottage-hive, that is, to remove it some few paces
off: when the hives are in a bee-house, a similar result
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">- 173 -</span>
may be obtained, by placing the new swarm for a day
or two to the entrance used by the bees when with the
old stock, and the old stock may be removed to an
approximate entrance. Some apiarians recommend that
a space be left between the two hives, by placing the
hives on the right and left of the old entrance, in order
that too large a proportion of bees should not enter the
new hive at the old position, to the impoverishment of
the other. But we have found the mode adopted with
the cottage-hive answer so well, that we see no reason
for recommending any different plan.</p>

<p>It is the office of the bee-master to assist, not in the
least degree to oppose, nature. We know that when a
natural swarm issues forth, it has its impregnated queen,
and, when located in a new abode, it commences building
worker-combs, leaving the building of the few drone-combs
to a later period; but if a division of the hive
should be made, by putting <i>half the combs</i> in one hive
and half in another, the hive that is either queenless or
contains an embryo queen will busy itself with building
only drone-comb; thus a number of receptacles for useless
bees is provided, which tends to weakness, and
eventually to loss of the hive.</p>

<p>In the plan we have recommended for forming two
separate families, we nearly follow the natural state of
things; the comb that the queen is upon is the only
one that is taken from the hive, and this vacancy should
be filled in by moving the frames together, so as to leave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">- 174 -</span>
the empty frame at the end. The bees, under the
government of the impregnated queen, construct the
combs and furnish their new above, as before stated,
with worker-cells.</p>

<p>By adopting the plan above described, the movable
bar and frame-hive will prove far superior to any of the
dividing hives, which provide for equal division of the
combs.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> At page 143 of Mr. Langstroth's "Honey Bee," other
methods of artificial swarming are described, the perusal of which
will well repay the scientific bee-keeper.</p>

</div>

<p>Perhaps the greatest advantage the movable frame-hive
possesses is, that a full knowledge can be attained
of its exact state as regards the queen, the population,
and the quantity of food in stock. During weather of
a genial temperature, the combs may on any fine day
be inspected, and thus, a knowledge being gained of the
deficiency existing in a hive, the necessary means may
be adopted for supplying the want. Sometimes such an
examination will verify the fears of the bee-keeper,
when, having observed that his bees have ceased to
carry in pollen, he has thereby received warning that
the queen has been lost at some juncture when no successor
to the throne could be provided. Such a hive
has entered on a downward course, and will dwindle
away entirely, unless a queen should be given to it, or
else some combs containing young brood not more
than three days old. By the latter method, the bee-keeper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">- 175 -</span>
will gain an opportunity of seeing the bees set
about their wonderful process of raising a queen from
the brood thus provided for them.</p>

<p>When a bee-keeper has become skilful in his calling,
he maybe desirous to encourage the breeding of queens,
or rather of preventing their destruction. He will seek
to use the propagating instincts of the worker-bees as
a set-off against that innate hatred of rivalry which
prompts the reigning queen to kill the tender royal brood.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="page175" style="width: 283px;">
  <img src="images/page175.png" width="283" height="326" alt="" />
</div>

<p>An ingenious little contrivance has been brought into
use by continental bee-keepers, especially by Herr Kleine,
a German pastor, to prevent the destruction alluded to.
It consists of a small wire cage (in fact, a pipe cover), as
represented in the above engraving, placed over a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">- 176 -</span>
queen-cell to protect it from the mother-bee's animosity,
and it also serves to prevent the young queen, when
hatched, from escaping; for she will have the same
jealous feeling toward her sister-princesses, should
there be more in the hive. The bee-master may thus
carefully remove and appropriate her.</p>

<p>Particular attention will have to be exercised to affix
the cage into the comb by pressure, as far as the middle
wall, but at no point must it touch the royal cell itself.
As the cage will probably project so as to touch the
adjoining comb, a little incision and removal of a portion
may be necessary, to allow space for it. It can,
however, be squeezed into any shape to suit the position
required.</p>

<p>This covering need not be put over the cell until the
egg is a little more than a week old. The animosity of
the reigning queen does not generally manifest itself
until the royal brood approaches maturity.</p>

<p>It is said that these cells are unmolested on the tenth
day, but that on the eleventh day they may be found
tenantless. Notwithstanding the apiarian's care and
skill, many disappointments are frequently experienced
in endeavouring to establishing fertile young queens at
the head of colonies.</p>

<p>Hives found to be queenless may be supplied either
with matured queens or with queen-cells. If the latter
are sufficiently numerous, their introduction may easily
be effected by exchanging a comb in each hive; if they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">- 177 -</span>
have to be cut out and place loosely in the new hive, a
triangular piece of comb should then be removed with
them, to be used as a block in preventing any pressure
coming on them. A space must be cut out of the middle
in the centre combs of the hive into which they are to
be introduced. Special care must be taken not to bruise
the royal embryos, as they are particularly sensitive to
pressure. It is sometimes best to introduce royal brood
into queenless hives in preference to matured <i>unimpregnated</i>
queens, because, as mentioned at <a href="#Page_8">page 8</a>, bees
are reluctant to receive virgin queens, whilst they will
tolerate one hatched in the hive, who will speedily
depart to seek a drone. Bee-masters mostly use small
hives for queen-rearing, consisting of, say, four combs.
By extracting from a populous hive four such frames of
combs (with the bees on them), and having eggs in the
first stage (see <a href="#Page_9">page 9</a>), or better still a royal embryo,
the bees will rear a queen or queens therefrom. Care
will have to be exercised to ensure that there is a sufficient
number of bees to mature the brood brought from
the hive.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> These weak little colonies should have small entrances, so as
to be better able to defend themselves from the attacks of robber-bees,
and they will require to be assisted and strengthened by
feeding.</p>

</div>

<p>A colony of this character is technically called a
"nucleus."</p>

<p>Such operations as queen-rearing should only be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">- 178 -</span>
attempted in warm summer weather, and when drones
are abundant.</p>

<p>A very great advantage that the Woodbury bar
and frame hive affords, is the safety and convenience
with which a stock of bees can in it be transported to
any part of the kingdom: by a few additional arrangements,
stocks have even been sent in it to distant countries.
In many districts hives are removed to moors,
and heaths in autumn, for the purpose of gathering
heather honey. In this operation, the frames are a
great support to the combs, very much lessening the
risk of a break down and consequent loss.</p>

<p>From a hive that has been inhabited all the winter, we
have not unfrequently lifted out the frames and removed
the stock to a clean hive; and we believe that the change
has always been useful The bees find a clean floor-board
and a clean hive to breed in, free from insects
that may have harboured in crevices about their former
abode. When the change has been made, the old hive
can be thoroughly cleaned and used in the same way
for making the exchange with another stock. The process
for handling will, of course, be the same as before
described. We have found that, where this plan has
been carried out, the bees seem to progress faster.
Perhaps a little stirring up may be useful in arousing
them from their winter doze. The time we recommend
for doing this is in the beginning of April, but a fine
warm day should be chosen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">- 179 -</span></p>


<h3 id="DRIVING">DRIVING.</h3>

<p>Driving is an operation by which bees are induced to
vacate an old settled hive and to enter an empty one.
Many apiarians prefer this mode of effecting an exchange
of hives to the plan of fumigating the bees.</p>

<p>The greatest success attending such a transfer will be
in the case of hives well filled with combs that are worked
nearly to the floor-board; and it may be remarked,
that bees are generally so far provident, that they leave
an open space in which to pass underneath their combs
over all the floor of the hive. When the old hive is
inverted, the bees crawl up the combs, and thus more
easily pass up into the new hive, which the operator
places over the old one, with the intent that they should
enter it.</p>

<p>The best time for performing this operation is about
the middle of the day, and when the weather is warm.
It is essential that the operator be protected with a bee-dress
and gloves, as before described; and previous to
commencing his task, he must provide all necessary
implements. These are:&mdash;a couple of hives, one of
which should correspond in shape and size with the hive
from which the bees are to be driven; a cloth to tie
round at the junction when the new hive is placed on the
old one; some string to keep the cloth in its place; an
empty pail to receive the top of the old hive, if one of
the old conical shape, but if the stock of bees is in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">- 180 -</span>
square box-hive with a flat top, a firm stool will be the
best; and a tube fumigator with some fungus, which
will complete the material of war. The bucket or stool
must be placed securely on the ground, about a yard
from the place where the full hive stands; then a few
puffs of smoke, blown in amongst the bees, will cause
them to retreat up amongst the combs. The bee-master
must now turn the hive<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> upside down very gently;
letting it rest in the pail or on the stool; he then quickly
places the empty hive over the full one, and ties the
cloth round it, to prevent any escape of the bees. If the
cloth be damped, it will cling the closer to the hives.
The third hive is intended to be placed on the stand
formerly occupied by the stock, so as to retain the few
returning bees which had been absent in the fields.
Care must be taken that all crevices through which it is
possible for the bees to escape from the united hives
should be effectually closed. When the two are fairly
united, the operator will proceed by rapping the full
hive gently with the hands or a couple of sticks, more
particularly on that side where the combs are the most
thickly placed&mdash;that is, if the hive be not equally filled.
A stock is in the best condition for driving twenty-one
days, or thereabouts, after a first swarm has issued; the
brood will then have hatched out, the bees will quit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">- 181 -</span>
more readily, and there will be no loss of larv&aelig; in the
cells.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">[22]</a> Care should be exercised in turning the hives over to keep
the combs vertical, or they are likely to break from their foundations.</p>

</div>

<p>It generally happens that, in about fifteen minutes, the
bees regularly commence the ascent; their exodus will
be known by the distinct rushing sound which is always
noticed when a colony of bees is on the move. The first
thing bees do when disturbed is to fill their honey-bags,
as they invariably do at swarming time; consequently,
after the first rush into the new hive is over, as in the
case of a swarm, the "flitting" bees are not much
disposed to take wing. When the noise made by the
ascending bees has been heard, and has in a great
degree subsided, the cloth may be removed, and the old
hive, now deserted, may be taken indoors; and if a few
bees yet remain, they may be brushed off with a feather.
An experienced apiarian, on first hearing the rushing
noise before mentioned, will not hesitate to tilt the top
hive over a little on one side, so that he may watch the
bees during the ascent; the queen may be seen passing
up, and if the operator desires to take her away, he can
secure her by placing a wine-glass over her. This expedient
is often resorted to in the autumn, when stocks
are to be united, for in such a case the removal of the
queen prevents some fighting.</p>

<p>If the taking of the honey be the object of the bee-master,
then "driving" is manifestly a better plan than
resorting to the fumes of sulphur for the purpose; for
the bees from whom the store is taken can be joined to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">- 182 -</span>
stocks that are weak in numbers, with considerable advantage
to the future prosperity of the apiary.</p>

<p>When the removed bees are to be joined to another
stock, the operator will proceed as follows:&mdash;At dusk,
dislodge the bees on to a cloth, sprinkle them with sweet
syrup, and place the hive to which it is intended to join
them over the mass; they will gradually ascend into
the hive placed for them, and early next morning the
hive, with its slender stock thus augmented, may be
removed to its stand. Should the operator not have been
successful, or not sufficiently skilful to gain possession of
the queen, he may leave it to the bees themselves to
decide which queen they will have.</p>

<p>By this plan of "driving," artificial swarms may be
secured by an "expert" even in common hives, though
those do not afford the facilities for such a purpose as do
the bar or bar-and-frame hives.</p>


<h3 id="CHANGING">CHANGING OLD STOCKS TO NEW HIVES.</h3>

<p>We frequently find that the possessor of a stock of
bees in a cottager's common straw hive is desirous of
removing the whole stock of bees and comb into one of
our improved hives, in which the honey may be obtained
without the destruction of the bees. We mostly discourage
such a transfer, attended as it is with much
labour, and requiring a considerable amount of apiarian
skill. An old-fashioned hive may very readily be rendered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">- 183 -</span>
a humane one, simply by cutting out with a sharp-pointed
knife the middle of the top of the hive; a piece may
thus easily be taken out, so as to leave a round hole two
or three inches in diameter, but care must be taken that
the knife does not penetrate much below the straw, lest it
reach the comb or the bees&mdash;and it will be safer for the
operator to have a bee-dress on. There should be ready
a round adapting-board, with a corresponding hole,
which may be secured on the top by putting four long
nails through the same number of holes in the board;
then a cap-hive or a glass may be placed on the top, for
the purpose of admitting the bees, who will soon crowd
therein to work.</p>

<p>This hive or glass will form a super or depriving-hive,
and can be worked as profitably as most of the improved
hives. For the sake of an improved appearance, an
outside case, either of zinc, straw, or wood, may be
dropped over all, and then, if well painted, the whole
will form no disfigurement to any flower-garden.</p>

<p>This is, beyond doubt, the easiest way of overcoming
the difficulty, but as it may not satisfy all, we now proceed
to describe how a complete transfer may be made. No
hive offers such facilities for the correct placing of the
combs in a perfectly upright position as does the bar-and-frame
hive. As before remarked, we should be slow
to recommend any one to attempt the operation who is
not already pretty well accustomed to the handling of
bees and acquainted with their habits; but by carefully
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">- 184 -</span>
carrying out the following directions any one
may successfully perform the feat. The first thing
is to get the bees away from the combs: there are
two ways of doing this,&mdash;one is by fumigation (see <a href="#Page_145">page
145</a>), the other by driving (see <a href="#Page_179">page 179</a>). Whichever
plan may be resorted to, have the bees confined in
the old hive on their stand until you are quite ready to
admit them into the bar-and-frame hive. Have in
readiness all the necessary appliances. These consist
of a large knife for cutting the hive, a good-sized table
on which to lay the brood-combs, a basin of water&mdash;for
washing off honey which may besmear the hands,&mdash;tape
or cotton string to fasten the combs in their frames, a
pair of honey-cutters for cutting out the combs, jars to
hold the honey that runs out, and a feather for brushing
off any bees that may remain. It is necessary that the
operator should have on his bee-dress and india-rubber
gloves. Then begin by slicing off a piece of the hive
with a sharp table-knife; carefully cut out the working
combs&mdash;cut them large, so that they will squeeze into
the frames; and, to be more secure, wind some of the
tape round to keep them in position until made fast by
the bees. After a few days, these fastenings may be
removed. Care should be taken that the combs occupy,
the same position in the frames as in the hive from
which they were extracted. Having thus prepared the
hive, the bees may be let into it, in the manner Mr.
Woodbury recommends for a swarm (see <a href="#Page_159">page 159</a>).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">- 185 -</span>
It may be as well to keep them confined a few hours,
giving them water at the top, until they make the
combs secure; the new hive will then be less likely to
offer an attraction to bees from other hives, who, if feloniously
inclined, might come to rob. This transfer
should be made when the weather is such that the bees
can fly about: when not warm enough, it should be done
in a room at a temperature of about 70 degrees. An expert
apiarian could perform the operation in less than
three quarters of an hour, and with little loss. A week or
so after a swarm has left the old stock is perhaps the
very best time for such a removal. Should the operation
be performed in the open air, the bees from surrounding
hives will be sure to come in great numbers to obtain a
share of the honey necessarily exposed, for they delight
in plunder. In order, therefore, to avoid annoyance to
the operator, and the excitement which is certain to be
induced in surrounding hives, it is better to conduct the
dissection in some building with closed doors. In some
instances a routing of this kind has a beneficial effect;
old stocks of hives that have previously appeared to be
dwindling are often aroused to activity by their removal
into a fresh domicile.</p>


<h3 id="WEIGHING_HIVES">WEIGHING HIVES, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>One of the most effectual modes of ascertaining the
condition of a hive is by weighing it. Such knowledge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">- 186 -</span>
is most important at the close of the gathering season,
in order that the bee-keeper may determine whether he
ought to give his bees artificial food to enable them to
live through the dreary winter. A knowledge of the
numerical strength of the colony is also useful, in
enabling the bee-keeper to decide which hives will
be benefited by being joined together, on the plan
explained in the articles
on "<a href="#BOX_FUMIGATOR">Fumigation</a>" and
"<a href="#DRIVING">Driving</a>."</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="page186" style="width: 242px;">
  <img src="images/page186.png" width="242" height="462" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A hive can very easily
be weighed, if a Salter's
Spring Balance be suspended
near the apiary.
The hive, having a strap
or cord passed under and
over it, crossing at right
angles on the top, may be
hooked on to the balance,
so that the weight will be
indicated on the dial.</p>

<p>The annexed engraving
represents a tripod stand,
with a weighing-machine
of the above-named construction,
to which a hive
with a super is attached.
Such an arrangement will be found convenient for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">- 187 -</span>
those bee-keepers who may not possess suitable sheds in
their gardens, where a hive could be thus suspended
from a beam.</p>

<p>This contrivance is both portable and simple, and
can be used from time to time; or, if the apiarian
desires to have the hive constantly suspended, a water-proof
covering might easily be made to drop over, and
adapted so as to admit of being raised occasionally for
ascertaining the weight shown on the dial.</p>

<p>To prevent the hive being swayed to and fro by the
wind, three cords (gear ropes) might be attached therefrom
to the three legs of the stand. The height of such
a stand need not exceed four feet.</p>

<p>Much interest might be derived by watching the daily
or hourly increasing store brought into a hive during
the gathering season.</p>

<p>Mr. George Fox, of Kingsbridge, and Mr. S. Bevan
Fox, of Exeter, have for some years each kept one
stock attached to a "Salter's Circular Spring Balance,"
suspended from a beam under a shed, and, from experience,
find that from a hive so balanced a criterion may
be formed of what other hives in the apiary are doing
through the day.</p>

<p>Many ingenious contrivances will, no doubt, suggest
themselves to the apiarian for suspending hives in this
manner. For instance, instead of the cord being tied
round the hive, three or four strong irons, with a screw
at one end and a ring at the other (known by iron
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">- 188 -</span>
mongers as "eyes"), could be screwed into the floor-boards,
to which the attachments might be made fast. It
will scarcely be necessary to hint that great care is
necessary that full provision should be made securely to
support the increasing weight; a fall would be most
ruinous, and terribly enrage the bees.</p>

<p>The weight of the hive should be marked on it when
empty, so that the exact amount of its contents may at
any time be ascertained. A colony of bees at Michaelmas
ought to weigh from 20 to 24 lbs., that is, exclusive
of the hive; if falling short of that weight, the hive
should be made up to it by the artificial means before
recommended.</p>

<p>Experienced apiarians are able to judge of the weight
of a hive by lifting it a few inches from the stand; or
by looking in at the windows of a stock-hive, a conclusive
opinion may be formed as to the state of the colony.
If the combs within view be well filled and sealed, it will
be safe to consider that the hive contains sufficient stores
to carry the bees through the winter.</p>

<h3>STINGS: THEIR PREVENTION AND CURE.</h3>

<div class="textleft" style="width: 49px;">
  <img src="images/letter_s.png" width="49" height="52" alt="S" />
</div>

<p class="p0">OME of our readers may deem us neglectful in
having, as it were, left them to struggle through
their bee-keeping novitiate without informing them how
to avoid being stung by their docile but well-armed
flock. Of course, having described the bee-dress, we
have supposed that the apiarian was clad, if not "in
complete steel," at least in the head-gear and gloves,
which will render him invulnerable. The best safeguard
from the anger of bees&mdash;as, indeed, from the malice of
men&mdash;is a quiet and peaceable spirit. The apiarian will
learn to handle his bees not only as "if he loved them,"&mdash;as
the quaint angler says&mdash;but as if he fully believes
that the bees love <i>him</i>. This they will do whenever he
approaches and treats them gently. There are some
cases of exception to this generally peaceable disposition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">- 190 -</span>
of the bee; perchance a few bees are dyspeptic, and
refuse to be pacified, let their master seek to bribe
them never so wisely. Then, too, sometimes the bee-master
himself may be dyspeptic, which the unerring
olfactory sense of the bees speedily detects, and their
anger is immediately aroused. Some few persons, owing
to constitutional peculiarities in their breath or insensible
perspiration, are objects of constant animosity with bees,
who, by driving them from the apiary, are giving a
physician's advice without charge for a fee. Some of
the choicest perfumes used by ladies are offensive to
bees; and one may feel very certain that the "fine puss
gentleman," who disgusted the brave Hotspur with his
"pouncet-box" and praise of "'parmaceti for an inward
bruise," would have been speedily driven from an
apiary in ignominious flight. Occasionally, even a
skilful apiarian may inadvertently crush a single bee;
such a mischance is detected by the community with
much more facility than by any "crowner's quest," and
their prompt verdict decrees the summary punishment
of the offender. There would be much less fear of stings
if it were always remembered that bees are never
aggressive. "Defence, not defiance," is their motto.
They scarcely ever attempt to sting when away from
the hive, and very seldom indeed at the time of swarming,
for then they are gorged with honey. When
molested by angry bees, do not attempt to beat them off;
the safest and best retreat is a green bush. Thrust your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">- 191 -</span>
head into this, or if no such refuge be near, in an
emergency, throw yourself on the ground, and, with face
downwards, the bees will soon leave you.</p>

<p>Yet some people appear to think they must inevitably
be stung if they meddle with bees and for their sakes it
is needful to explain why it is that a sting is painful, and
how the wound inflicted by the bee may be cured. Those
familiar with the usual microscopic objects will know
how marvellously delicate, and yet effective, is the mechanical
structure of a bee's sting. (See <a href="#Page_46">page 46</a>.)
This weapon, as we see it with our naked eye&mdash;finer
than a needle's point&mdash;is only the sheath, which lengthens
or contracts like the tubes of a telescope. The dart, as
before said, is barbed on each side, so that the bee, when
<i>very</i> angry, is scarcely ever able to withdraw it, but</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"Deems life itself to vengeance well resigned;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Dies on the wound, and leaves the sting behind."</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">There are, indeed, some happy mortals whose "blood
such an even tenour keeps," that a bee-sting is to them
simply a puncture, and nothing more. Dr. Bevan has
suggested that lovers should subject themselves to the
ordeal of a bee-sting, in order to prove, we suppose,
that their temper is proof against "the stings and
arrows of any outrageous fortune" that matrimony can
bring.</p>

<p>It is the homoeopathically minute tincture of poison
injected by the bee which causes inflammation. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">- 192 -</span>
first thing to do is, to remove the sting, which, even when
detached from the bee, will continue to penetrate still
further into the wound. Next, press the hollow point
of a watch-key exactly over the place stung; this will
express a considerable portion of the virus. Then dip
the hand, or bathe the part with cold or tepid water, for
the poison is volatile, and will thereby be dissipated to
a great extent. On no account whatever should the
part affected be rubbed; to do that will diffuse the poison
and increase the inflammation. The specific remedy for
a bee-sting is taught us by chemistry: the venom is an
acid which an alkali will immediately neutralize when
brought into contact with it. Spirits of hartshorn will
generally be found effectual for the purpose, and should
always be kept in an apiary. There are also several
other remedies more or less effectual, according to the
special constitution of the patient. A strong infusion of
tobacco-water applied to the wound after the sting has
been extracted is a specific for many persons; others
find relief from the application of a sliced onion.</p>

<p>We have heard the remark from several who have
kept bees for years, that the poison from a sting has little
or no effect on them; after receiving many inflictions,
their flesh appears to become so little affected, that the
swelling and pain at one time experienced no longer
trouble them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">- 193 -</span></p>


<h3 id="POLLEN">POLLEN, OR FOOD FOR INFANT-BEES.</h3>

<p>Bees, when fully grown, feed almost wholly on honey;
but the larvae require for their development a more substantial
kind of nourishment. Such solid fare is found
by the bees in the <i>pollen</i> of flowers, a farina which contains
some of those nitrogenous elements in which honey
is deficient. The body of a worker-bee is covered with
hairs, to which the pollen adheres when, by contact with
the bee, it is rubbed from the anthers and stamens
of flowers (see <a href="#Page_41">page 41</a>). Dewy mornings or humid
bowers suit the bees for the gathering of the pollen. If the
atmosphere be too dry for kneading it into pellets, they
roll themselves in the blossoms and trust to the good offices
of the bees at home, who, on their return, brush off the
farina into the cells intended for it. A portion of this
"bee-bread" is taken at once by the "nursing bees,"
who are supposed to subject it to some change before
offering it to the larv&aelig;; but the greater part of the
pollen is stored away and sealed over in the cells for
future use. In April and May, the bees are frequently
busy "all the day" in gathering pollen, and often one
community of bees will collect about twenty pounds
weight of "bee-bread" in one season.</p>

<p>One of the objects of the apiarian is to assist the bees
in providing for the nurslings of the hive. A German
pastor, Herr Dzierzon, first suggested the plan of providing
the bees with "unbolted rye meal," as a substitute
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">- 194 -</span>
for the farina of flowers. He had observed that, in
early spring, before the flowers were open, his bees had
entered a neighbouring corn mill, from whence they
returned laden with rye flour. Since his discovery,
some keepers, in early spring, place either rye or wheat
meal near the apiaries; to this artificial store the bees
repair by thousands, and seem to rollick in the enjoyment
of such plenty, many of them returning to the hive
as dusty as millers. The object in thus supplying them
is, that the brood may be rapidly brought forward, and
early swarming induced. In this way, a few pounds of
rye meal, at one penny per pound, may tend to the
production of very many pounds of honey of twelve times
the price.</p>

<p>In gathering pollen from flowers, bees are doing more
than merely providing for their own community. Whilst
humming through our gardens they are assisting to
propagate our flowers, and their merry buzz in our
orchards indicates that the blossoms of spring will in
autumn fulfil their promise by abundance of fruit. In
Mr. Darwin's remarkable work, "The Fertilization
of Orchids," the mystery of the fructification of flowers
is scientifically explained; but before the subject was so
fully understood, it was quite believed that bees, in
passing from flower to flower, performed some important
service. Owners of fruit-trees have noticed, in a season
generally unfavourable for the orchard, that if during
only one fine forenoon the bees had spread freely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">- 195 -</span>
amongst the blossoms of a particular tree, it would
prove more fruitful than its fellows. On this account,
the orchard is a good place for an apiary, for it seems
that, more abundant the honey, more plentiful will be
the fruit. Bees bear the fructifying matter from one <i>sex</i>
of flowers to the other, but they confine their attention
to one <i>kind</i> of flower during each excursion; and the
careful observer may see how the colour of the pollen on
the bodies of the bees will vary from yellow to red and
brown, according to the kind of flowers from which it
has been gathered. The gathering of pollen, its use by
the nursing bees, and the storing of it in the cells, afford
to the bee-keeper opportunity for observations of exceeding
interest.</p>


<h3 id="PROPOLIS">PROPOLIS, OR BEES' CEMENT.</h3>

<p>The old notion that wax is gathered by bees from
flowers, as they gather honey, has long since been set
aside by the discoveries of Hornbostel and Huber. Wax
is an oily substance, as described at <a href="#Page_45">page 45</a>; but
there is "a resinous substance, very tenacious and semi-transparent,"
which is indispensable for the bees as a
cement wherewith to fix their combs and fortify their
hives against intruders, and this is "propolis." The
bees, in working the propolis, often soften it by blending
it with a portion of wax; but they have to extract it in
its natural state directly from the bark and buds of certain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">- 196 -</span>
trees. The bark of the willow, the leaf-buds of the
poplar and alder, and the unopened blossoms of the
hollyhock are very usual sources of propolis. In the
case of a new swarm, as bees must have this glue before
they can begin to build their combs, they will resort to
most unlikely places to obtain it. Sometimes they will
enter a paint shop and attack the varnish, and it is
said they have been seen to obtain propolis from the
pitch and rigging of a ship. These circumstances
afford intelligible hints to the apiarian, who, if his bees
have not easy access to firs, poplars, or willows, will
provide some glutinous or resinous matter which may
serve for a substitute. The extraction of propolis costs
the bees very considerable labour, which they should be
relieved of as much as possible, in order to facilitate
their great work of honey gathering. Bees choose the
warmer part of the day during which to gather propolis,
as then it does not so rapidly stiffen, frequently,
when they arrive at the hive, it has become so hard that
the other bees are scarcely able to gnaw it from their
thighs.</p>

<p>With propolis bees fasten down their hives, stop up
crevices to exclude moths and ants, and sometimes use
it to narrow the entrance of their hives against the invasion
of wasps. Extraordinary anecdotes are told of the
prompt and ingenious use they make of this substance.
Reaumur relates, that a snail having been observed by
the bees oh the window of the hive, they proceeded to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">- 197 -</span>
glue the shell to the glass, and there sealed down the
intruder in hopeless durance. In another case, that of
a slug, or snail without a shell, the bees, having slain it
with their stings, were quite unable to remove it from
the hive. With wonderful foresight, they then proceeded
to secure their community from the noxious effects likely
to arise from the decay of the carcase; and this they did
by completely enveloping it with a coating of impervious
varnish. Huish relates a similar occurrence in
the case of a mouse caught in a hive by bees. Propolis
yields benzoic acid, and contains some aromatic properties.</p>


<h3 id="PASTURAGE">PASTURAGE FOR BEES.</h3>

    <div class="verse indent0">"Bees work for man; and yet they never bruise</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">As fair as ever, and as fit for use."</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Apiarians generally agree in the opinion that very
little can be done in the way of providing any special
forage for bees. Yet bee-fanciers are always interested
in observing which are the flowers that the bees prefer;
and there are certain well-established conclusions as to
the kind of district and seasons which are the likeliest
to produce a good honey-harvest. There is an old saying,
that a country which produces the finest wool also
yields the best honey; and a pastoral district is decidedly
better than one under tillage. The principle of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">- 198 -</span>
matter is, that the bees are best suited with a long dry-season&mdash;an
early spring, a hot summer, and a late autumn.
As not one of these blessings can be commanded by
the apiarian, his art must be applied to provide some
mitigation of the injury suffered by the bees when the
season is short or wet. For early spring, the crocus, the
blue hepatica, and the violet all afford good supplies of
pollen and honey, and, if cultivated near the apiary, will
be of great service when the wild flowers are backward.
All varieties of the willow and poplar furnish early supplies,
of honey, as well as of the propolis of which we
have spoken; the blossoms of the gooseberry and currant
are very useful for the bees in May. Wet, when it enters
flowers of any kind, prevents the tongue of the bee from
reaching the secret source of honey. On this account,
it is well to know, as does the bee, that the drooping
blossoms of the raspberry escape the effect of the showers,
and honey is gathered from them when other flowers are
drenched within as well as without. For a similar reason,
borage (<i>Borago officinalis</i>) is valuable for bees; and also
because that plant continues to flower until the frosts set
in. The honey both from raspberry blossoms and
borage is very superior. Mr. Langstroth says, that "the
precipitous and rocky lands of New England, which
abound with the wild red raspberry, might be made
almost as valuable as some of the vine-clad terraces of
the mountain districts of Europe." The "golden rod"
and also asters afford superior honey for autumn gathering.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">- 199 -</span>
Dzierzon strongly recommends buck-wheat being
sown in the winter stubbles on behalf of the bees, and
he tries hard to persuade farmers that it is to their interest
to cultivate it. It should be named that all the ordinary
fruit blossoms, especially those of the apple, supply
abundant store for bees.</p>

<p>It is, however, to wild or field flowers that the bee-master
must chiefly look for the raw material on which his
myriad artisans shall exert their skill. The white clover of
the pasture<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>&mdash;the wild thyme on the hill&mdash;the heather on
the moors&mdash;the furze and the broom on the sandy waste&mdash;offer
exhaustless stores for a greater number of bees
than can ever be located near them. Lime-trees, when
in blossom, and mignonette are also' most valuable
resources. There are also two or three peculiar sources
of honey which one would not have suspected, as, for
instance, the blossoms of the onion plant, of turnips,
and, in still greater degree, the flower of the mustard
plant.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> It is a good practice to induce the owners of adjacent fields
to sow clover-seed.</p>

</div>

<p>In those districts of England where mustard seed is
cultivated so extensively, it would be well worth while
for the farmers to keep large colonies of bees. Another,
but a very uncertain, source of honey is the "honeydew,"
which, in some seasons, appears in large quantities
on the leaves of the oak, the lime, and some other
trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">- 200 -</span></p>

<p>It is important to mention that bees, in the principal
breeding season, require a plentiful supply of water.
Owing either to their carelessness or eagerness, they are
frequently drowned when drinking from any large quantity
of water; the bee-keeper should, therefore, place
near the hives shallow vessels of water containing pebbles,
on which the bees may alight to take frequent but
temperate draughts.</p>


<h3 id="LIGURIAN">THE LIGURIAN OR ITALIAN ALP BEE.</h3>

<p>A new, or rather a re-discovered, variety of bee has
recently been brought into practical use amongst apiarians
in Germany and America, as well as in this
country. The ordinary bee is the <i>Apis mellifica</i> of naturalists;
the new kind is the <i>Apis ligustica</i>. It was also named
"the Ligurian Bee" by the Marquis de Spinola, who
found it in Piedmont in 1805; and he considered it to be
the principal species known to the Greeks, who speak of
the "best kind" of bee as being of a red colour. Leading
apiarians agree in pronouncing these bees to be
justly entitled to the high character given them. (See
coloured engraving, <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I., figs, 1, 2, 3.</a>) Their special
advantages are&mdash;greater fecundity of the queens, less
irascibility, and a more handsome appearance, for,
being of a golden colour, they are prettier than our
black bees.</p>

<p>Tennyson most probably refers to these Ligurian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">- 201 -</span>
bees in the following stanza of his beautiful poem
"Eleanore":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"Or the <i>yellow banded bees</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Through half-open lattices,</div>
    <div class="verse indent5">Coming in the scented breeze,</div>
    <div class="verse indent5">Fed thee, a child, lying alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">With whitest honey in fairy gardens culled:</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">A glorious child, dreaming alone</div>

    <div class="verse indent5">With the hum of swarming bees</div>
    <div class="verse indent5">Into dreamful slumbers lulled."</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Our own experience with the Italian Alp bee enables
us to corroborate the statements which have been made
in favour of this new variety. We find the queens more
prolific than those of the common kind, and the quantity
of honey produced is greater. These two facts stand
as cause and effect: the bees being multiplied more
quickly, the store of honey is accumulated more rapidly,
and the Italian bees consume, if anything, less food than
the common, kind. When of pure Italian blood, these
bees are, by some apiarians, thought to be hardier than
our own. That they forage for stores with greater
eagerness, and have little hesitation in paying visits to
other hives, we can testify from our own observation.
The following anecdote will illustrate their intrusive
propensities:&mdash;Another bee-keeper living in the neighbourhood
of our apiary, when inspecting our hives, observed
the yellow bees: he exclaimed, "Now, I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">- 202 -</span>
found out where those strange-looking bees come from;
for," said he, "these yellow-jackets are incessant visitors
to my hives. I thought they were a species of wasp that
had come to rob, and until now I have been unable to
account for their appearance at the entrance of my hive,
so that I have killed them by hundreds." This was not
at all pleasing intelligence for us, and we trust that our
neighbour has been more lenient to "the yellow-jackets"
since his visit, for such summary capital punishment
was wholly unmerited, because, when a bee is peaceably
received (see <a href="#Page_127">page 127</a>), it becomes naturalized,
and works side by side with the others in its fresh abode.
We are inclined to believe that more visiting takes place
amongst bees of different hives than bee-keepers have
been accustomed to suppose: where the Italian and
black bees are kept near each other, the foreigners
being conspicuous by their lighter colour, there is less
difficulty in identifying them when at the entrance of
other hives.</p>

<p>In the season of 1864, we had more honey from a
Ligurian stock than from any one of our colonies of
black bees. From this Ligurian hive we have taken
a glass super containing 40 lbs. nett of honey, besides
having drawn from it an artificial swarm; and, after all,
it remains the strongest hive in our apiary.</p>

<p>The Baron Von Berlepsch and Pastor Dzierzon, who
are probably the two most intelligent and skilful bee-keepers
of Germany, award to the Italian a very decided
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">- 203 -</span>
preference over the common bees. The Baron says that
he has found:&mdash;"1. That the Italian bees are less sensitive
to cold than the common kind. 2. That their queens
are more prolific. 3. That the colonies swarm earlier
and more frequently. 4. That they are less apt to sting,
5. They are more industrious. 6. That they are
more disposed to rob than common bees, and more
courageous and active in self-defence. They strive,
whenever opportunity offers, to force their way into
colonies of common bees; but when strange bees attack
their hives, they fight with great fierceness and with
incredible adroitness."</p>

<p>It is said that the Italian bee can extract honey from
some flowers which the common bee is unable to penetrate.
For instance, the blossom tubes of the red clover
being too deep for the probosces of the common bees,
that flower is useless to them, although so plentiful; but,
says Mr. Langstroth, the American apiarian, the Italian
bee visits the red clover assiduously, and draws large
quantities of honey from it.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> This opinion is not held by the closest observer of Italian
bees in England.</p>

</div>

<p>The introduction of this new variety of bee into England
was through our agency. M. Hermann, a bee-cultivator
at Tamins-by-Chur, Canton Grison, Switzerland,
wrote to us on the 5th July, 1859, offering to supply
us with Italian Alp queen-bees. This letter, or an extract
from it, appeared in the current number of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">- 204 -</span>
<i>Journal of Horticulture</i> (then called the <i>Cottage Gardener</i>),
a periodical that regularly opens its columns to apiarian
subjects. Prior to this the Italian Alp, or, as it has been
named, the "Ligurian" bee, was <span class="smcap">unknown in this
country</span>, except to a few naturalists. The letter referred
to attracted the attention of that intelligent apiarian,
T. W. Woodbury, Esq., now so well known as the
"Devonshire Bee-Keeper." On the 19th of July, that
is, a fortnight after M. Hermann's offer, we received a
consignment of Italian Alp bees,&mdash;the first imported
into England. With these Mr. Woodbury also received
one queen-bee and a few workers, which he introduced
into a hive of English bees from which the queen had
been taken. His efforts were very successful, and "the
spring of 1860 found him in possession of four Ligurianized
stocks." His subsequent experience with the Italian
Alp bee he has fully described in a communication to
the <i>Bath and West of England Agricultural Journal</i>.</p>

<p>Subsequently, M. Hermann sent us a copy of his
pamphlet, entitled "The Italian Alp Bee; or, the Gold-Mine
of Husbandry," with the request that we should
have it translated from the German, and that copies of it
should be printed in the English language. The
pamphlet was speedily published by us, and although
singular as a literary production, it may be useful for the
advanced apiarian.</p>

<p>Certainly the bees are partially of an orange or
golden colour, and if one could believe the golden anticipations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">- 205 -</span>
indulged in by M. Hermann respecting them,
it would be sufficient to identify the Italian Alp bee as the
species described by Hood in "Miss Kilmansegg";&mdash;those
which dwelt in</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"A golden hive, on a golden bank,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Where golden bees, by alchemical prank,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Gather gold instead of honey."</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If we are correctly informed, poor Hermann himself
has not yet greatly profited by the discovery of the mine.
He appears to have quitted Switzerland, and travelled
to America, as, by the latest accounts, we learn that he
is now in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, prosecuting
his favourite calling with his accustomed ardour,
among the apiaries of amateur bee-keepers. We are
glad that M. Hermann is thus engaged, for report had
reached us that he was dead&mdash;a report to which we gave
currency in our first edition.</p>

<p>In the pamphlet referred to, M. Hermann gives the
following description of what he insists on designating as
<i>Apis Helvetica</i>:&mdash;"The yellow Italian Alp bee is a
mountain insect; it is found between two mountain
chains to the right and left of Lombardy and the Rhetian
Alps, and comprises the whole territory of Tessins,
Veltlin, and South-Graubunden. It thrives up to the
height of 4,500 feet above the level of the sea, and appears
to prefer the northern clime to the warmer, for in
the south of Italy it is not found. The Alps are their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">- 206 -</span>
native country, therefore they are called Yellow Alp-bees,
or tame house-bees, in contradistinction to the black.
European bees, whom we might call common forest
bees, and who, on the slightest touch, fly like lightning
into your face. (?)</p>

<p>"As all good and noble things in the world are more
scarce than common ones, so there are more common
black bees than of the noble yellow race, which latter
inhabit only a very small piece of country, while the
black ones are at home everywhere in Europe, and even
in America."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the emigration of M. Hermann from
his native land, we shall in future be able to supply all
bee-keepers who may wish to possess stocks of the
genuine yellow Alpine bees.</p>

<p>The Italian varies but little from the common bees in
its physical characteristics. The difference in appearance
consists in the first rings of the abdomen, except
the posterior edge, and the base of the third, being of
an orange colour instead of a deep brown. These
orange-coloured parts are transparent when closely examined
with the sun shining on them. The Italian
bees are more active than common bees when on the
wing.</p>

<p>During the summers of 1859 and 1860 we had over
from the Continent a great number of Ligurian queens;
these were sent to all parts of the kingdom. We regret
to say that but few were successfully united to English
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">- 207 -</span>
stocks. It requires a considerable amount of apiarian
skill to accomplish the union,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> so that we find by experience
it is best to send out complete Ligurian stocks.
This is particularly desirable now that the packing of
whole hives is so easily accomplished by us with the aid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">- 208 -</span>
of bars and frames. We have sent a great number of
stocks to all parts by rail.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[25]</a> The plan of uniting an Italian queen to an English stock
is, first, to discover the queen by lifting out the frames, then take
her away. This, we find, is best done by putting a wine-glass
over her whilst on the comb, and, with a card a little larger than
the diameter of the glass, very carefully and gently passed underneath,
so as not to injure her majesty, she is thus, with a few of
her subjects, made a prisoner, and easily removed. Be careful to
cut away with a penknife all queen-cells. Let the hive remain
queenless for twenty-four hours, and then place the Italian queen
in a small wire cage, the openings of which must be large
enough to enable her to receive the attentions of, and to communicate
with, her new subjects, and, at the same time, to defend her
from the animosity with which bees regard a stranger-queen, that
has a scent different from that of her new home. Three or four
days' intercourse through the wire meshes generally has a reconciling
effect, and the Italian queen may be let go free to become
the monarch of the hive. Sometimes, even with all this precaution,
the foreigner is slain, so that it is well to preserve the black
queen alive (with a few of her own subjects), by feeding and
keeping her warm until the result is known. The wire cage
containing the new queen is made of a flat shape, so as to be
pressed down between the combs, against some honey-cells, in
order that, should the inhabitants of the hive be inattentive, her
majesty need not starve, but have food within reach. As it is
generally considered that the queen is fed by working bees, it is
always necessary to put about half a dozen of <i>her own subjects</i> in
the cage with her, to pay her the requisite attention.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Woodbury, owing to his knowledge and skill in
bee-keeping, was eminently successful in propagating
the Ligurian bees first imported into this country; and
we would recommend all who may be interested in the
subject to peruse the interesting articles written by him
in the <i>Journal of Horticulture</i>. He has shown great
patience and energy by his labours in the rearing of
queens and the multiplication of stocks, for which he
merits all praise.</p>

<p>We now add to the testimonies already cited that of
Mr. Woodbury, as to the superior qualities of Ligurian
bees. The following is extracted from the paper contributed
by him to the <i>Bath and West of England Agricultural
Journal</i>:&mdash;"From my strongest Ligurian stock I
took eight artificial swarms in the spring, besides depriving
it of numerous brood-combs. Finding, in June,
that the bees were collecting honey so fast that the
queen could not find an empty cell in which to lay an
egg, I was reluctantly compelled to put on a super.
When this had been filled with 38 lbs. of the finest
honeycomb,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> I removed it, and as the stock-hive (a very
large one) could not contain the multitude of bees which
issued from it, I formed them into another very large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">- 209 -</span>
artificial swarm. The foregoing facts speak for themselves;
but as information on this point has been very
generally asked, I have no hesitation in saying that I
believe the Ligurian honey-bee infinitely superior in
every respect to the only species that we have hitherto
been acquainted with."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> This super was exhibited at our stand in the International
Exhibition of 1862.</p>

</div>

<p>In a private letter received from Mr. Langstroth, he
informs us that he has, in the season of 1865, bred over
300 Ligurian queens; these he has disseminated to
various bee-masters on the American continent, and the
united opinion of apiarians in that country is increasingly
in favour of the decided advantage of the cultivation
of the Italian bee.</p>

<p>After such emphatic testimony as this, corroborated, as
it is, by many other observers, there seems every reason
to expect that the Ligurian bee will gradually supersede
the common kind throughout the United Kingdom.
The honey-bee of the Holy Land is the Ligurian.</p>

<p>The Rev. H. B. Tristram, M.A., in his valuable book,
"The Land of Israel," has the following interesting
account of the bees in that country:&mdash;In Palestine bee-keeping
is not an unimportant item of industry, and every
house possesses a pile of bee-hives in its yard. Though
similar in its habits, the hive-bee of Palestine is a different
species to our own. "We never," he says, "found
<i>Apis mellifica</i>, L., our domestic species, in the country,
though it very possibly occurs in the north; but the
common Holy Land insect, <i>Apis ligustica</i>, is amazingly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">- 210 -</span>
abundant; both in hives, in rocks, and in old hollow,
trees. It is smaller [?] than our bees, with brighter yellow,
bands: on the thorax and abdomen, which, is rather
wasp-like in shape, and with very long antenn&aelig;. In its
habits, and especially in the immense population of
neuters in each community, and in the drones cast forth
in autumn, it resembles the other species. Its sting, also,
is quite as sharp. The hives are very simple, consisting
of large tubes of sun-dried mud, like gas-pipes, about
four feet long, and closed with mud at each end, leaving
only an aperture in the centre, large enough for two or
three bees to, pass at a time. The insects appear to
frequent both doors equally. The tubes are laid in rows
horizontally, and piled in a pyramid. I counted one of
these colonies, consisting of seventy-eight tubes, each a
distinct hive. Coolness being the great object, the whole
is thickly plastered over with mud, and covered with
boughs, while a branch is stuck in the ground at each end,
to assist the bees in alighting. At first we took these
singular structures for ovens or hen-houses. <i>The barbarous
practice of destroying the swarms for their honey is unknown.</i>
When the hives are fully, the clay is removed from the
ends of the pipes, and the honey extracted with an
iron hook; those pieces of comb which contain young
bees being carefully replaced, and the hives then closed
up again. Everywhere during our journey we found
honey was always to be purchased; and it is used by
the natives for many culinary purposes, and especially
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">- 211 -</span>
for the preparation of sweet cakes. It has the delicate
aromatic flavour of the thyme-scented honey of Hybla
or Hymettus.</p>

<p>"But, however extensive are the bee-colonies of the
villages, the number of wild bees of the same species
is far greater. The innumerable fissures, and clefts of
the limestone rocks, which everywhere flank the valleys,
afford in their recesses secure shelter for any number of
swarms; and many of the Bedouin, particularly in the
wilderness of Jud&aelig;ea, obtain: the subsistence by bee-hunting,
bringing into Jerusalem jars of that wild, honey
on which John the Baptist fed in the wilderness, and
which Jonathan had long before unwittingly tasted, when
the comb had dropped on the ground from the hollow
tree in which it was suspended. The visitor to the
Wady Kurn, when he sees the busy multitudes of bees
about its cliffs, cannot but recall to mind the promise,
'With honey out of the stony rock would I have satisfied
thee.' There is no epithet of the Land of Promise more
true to the letter, even to the present day, than this,
that it was 'a land flowing with milk and honey."</p>

<p>Does not evidence such as this point to the conclusion
that the bees which Sampson found in the carcase of the
lion were <i>Ligurian</i>; and may we not further speculate
that the ribs of the carcase constituted the first <i>bar-hive?</i>
Surely, "there is no new thing under the sun."</p>

<h3 id="LIVING_BEES">LIVING BEES AT THE INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION OF 1862,
SENDING BEES TO AUSTRALIA, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>The engraving represents our stand in the Agricultural
Department of the International Exhibition of 1862.
The space granted us in the World's Great Fair was somewhat
limited; but we were able to exhibit a tolerably
complete stock of apiarian apparatus, and all the more
important bee-hives. Amongst these was an unicomb
hive stocked with the Yellow Alpine or "Ligurian" bee.
This was an object of great attention, and daily hundreds
of visitors flocked round our stand, in order to watch the
movements of the Italian queen, with her gay and busy
subjects. The entrance-way for the bees being in the
"Open Court," to which all visitors had access, it was
necessary to place the hive in an elevated position, so
as for it to be beyond the reach of incautious passers-by,
and to obviate any chance of annoyance to the vast
crowds of people continually around.</p>

<p>Among others who took a deep interest in our exhibition
was Mr. Edward Wilson, President of the Acclimatisation
Society of Victoria. This gentleman requested
us to pack four stocks of the Ligurian bees for
conveyance to Melbourne. With the assistance of
Mr. Woodbury&mdash;whose aid was, indeed, essential&mdash;these
stocks were sent off on the 25th of September, 1862, by
the steam ship Alhambra, so as to arrive at the colony
during the Austral summer. The hives were Woodbury
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">- 214 -</span>
frame hives, having ample space and ventilation, as well
as the means of supplying water to their inmates during
the voyage; there was, also, a sufficient store of honey
to last until the following March. The bees arrived at
Melbourne, where they were released after an imprisonment
of seventy-nine days, and have since rapidly multiplied,
the climate and pasturage of Australia greatly
favouring the increase of this superior variety of the bee.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson was so well pleased with the careful
manner in which these stocks were fitted out for their
voyage across the seas, that he subsequently instructed
us to prepare him three more hives, which were sent
out in a sailing vessel. Owing to the mismanagement
of the water supply during the voyage, only one stock
survived in this instance. Mr. Wilson informs us that
one of these hives contained 136 lbs. of honey, on the
25th of December, 1864 (Midsummer in Australia).</p>

<p>Upwards of twenty years ago, we sent a Nutt's hive
stocked with bees to New Zealand. We then adopted
the plan of fixing the hive in a meat safe, so that the
bees could fly about a little, and also cleanse the hive
of their dead, for bees are very attentive to sanitary
arrangements; they always remove the dead ones from
their midst, and do not void excrement within the hive.</p>

<p>When bees are shut up in their hives too long, even
with adequate ventilation, they are apt to be attacked by
a disease called by apiarians dysentery. Sometimes,
when confined by the unfavourableness of the weather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">- 215 -</span>
in winter, or the lateness of spring, this disease produces
serious mischief amongst the bees. Various
remedies have been recommended; but we believe, the
best is to see that there is wholesome food within the
hive, and plenty of it, and, when fine weather returns,
the health of the bees will return with it. Dampness of
the hives, and too late feeding in the autumn, are also
frequent causes of this disease.</p>


<h3 id="BEE-KEEPING_IN_LONDON">BEE-KEEPING IN LONDON.</h3>

<p>There are many persons now in this noisy city pent,
who frequently remember the days of childhood, when,
among pastures of clover, or amidst flowery heath and
woodlands, they listened to the cheerful hum of bees.
Partly from a desire to revive these old associations, and
also from a natural liking for the tendance of living
creatures, such persons would be glad to keep bees if
they thought it possible to do so in London or its
suburbs with any chance of success. We do not wonder
that many should doubt even the possibility of bees feeding
themselves amidst such an "endless meal of brick;"
but we can easily prove that bees, if not placed too near
to smoky chimneys, are able to produce honey, both for
themselves and for their masters. To make this plain,
we will mention some special instances of metropolitan
bee-keeping.</p>

<p>About ninety years ago, a Mr. Wildman kept a bee-house
and honey warehouse, near to Middle Row,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">- 216 -</span>
Holborn. He was not only a tradesman, but was also
the apiarian of his day. He kept hives of thriving bees
on the roof of his house in Holborn, and many of the
nobility and gentry used to mount thither, in order to
inspect the apiary. At that period, St. Pancras was a
"village two miles north-west of London," and what
is now the Regent's Park was open country. It was
then much easier for London bees to find their favourite
forage, but Mr. Wildman believed that his hives were
filled with stores from a considerable distance. Whilst
enjoying his country rambles on Hampstead Heath, he
had a shrewd suspicion that many of the bees he there
observed gathering honey were labourers from his own
apiary. In order to identify his own flock amongst the
rest, he hit upon a homely but very effective expedient.
Having borrowed Mrs. Wildman's "dredging box,"
he stationed himself near the entrance of his hives, and
gently dusted his bees with flour as they issued forth.
He then betook himself to Hampstead, where he found
his previous surmise confirmed, for there were numbers
of his bees in their livery of white.</p>

<p>Wildman became noted for the remarkable control
he obtained over his bees, many instances of which he
exhibited before the public. Several of his operations with
them were regarded as feats of legerdemain by the
uninitiated, as when he appeared before King George III.,
with a swarm of bees hanging in festoons from his
chin, or suspended in a cluster at arm's length. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">- 217 -</span>
<i>Journal of Horticulture</i> recently, in alluding to Wildman,
gives the following particulars as to his performances:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Near the 'Three Hats,' Islington, was a place of popular
entertainment called 'Dobney's Tea Gardens,' kept by Mrs.
Ann Dobney. These gardens occupied the ground between
White Lion Street and Winchester Place, and were established
as far back as 1728. In 1771, the house was taken for a short
time as a boarding school; but it was soon changed to its original
purpose as a place of amusement, for, in 1772, Daniel
Wildman exhibited bees here. This is a copy of the advertisement:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'June 20, 1772. Exhibition of bees on horseback! at the
Jubilee Gardens, Islington (late Dobney's), this and every
evening, until further notice (wet evenings excepted).</p>

<p>"'The celebrated Daniel Wildman will exhibit several new
and amazing experiments, never attempted by any man in this or
any other kingdom before. The rider standing upright, one
foot on the saddle and one on the neck, with a mask of bees on
his head and face. He also rides standing upright on the
saddle with the bridle in his mouth, and, by firing a pistol, makes
one part of the bees march over the table, and the other swarm in
the air and return to their hive again, with other performances too
tedious to insert. The doors open at six; to begin at a quarter
before seven. Admittance:&mdash;Box and gallery, 2<i>s.</i>; the other
seats, 1<i>s.</i>'"</p>
</div>

<p>The secret of Wildman's skilful manipulation is well
understood now; it consisted in a careful holding and
disposal of the queen, together with confidence in the
generally inoffensive disposition of bees. Dr. Evans,
whom we have often quoted for his correct information
in apiarian matters, thus speaks of his feats:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">- 218 -</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"Such was the spell which, round a Wildman's arm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Twined in dark wreaths the fascinated swarm;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Bright o'er his breast the glittering legions led,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Or with a living garland bound his head.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">His dextrous hand, with firm, yet hurtless hold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Could seize the chief, known by her scales of gold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Prune, 'mid the wondering train, her filmy wing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Or o'er her folds the silken fetter fling."</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To recur to our subject. After the days of Wildman,
our own establishment in Holborn became widely known
for bee-hives and honey. Although we never attempted
to start a London apiary at all approaching in extent
that of our predecessor, we have occasionally kept bees
on the house-top, both in Holborn and Regent Street.
At each of those situations, we have noticed that the bees
bring "pollen" as well as honey into their hives. Last
summer, there was brought under our notice an illustration
of the acuteness of the scent of bees and of
their diligent search for food, proving, too, that if sweets
can be obtained even from unusual sources, the bees
will find them out. A poor woman, who, at the comer
of an adjacent street, vends "brandy balls," "toffee,"
"rock," and other saccharine compounds&mdash;all well
known to and appreciated by most juveniles,&mdash;used to
receive frequent visits from our bees. Their visits to the
old dame's domain were at first rather interesting, and
if the few pioneers who had the sagacity to find such a
store had kept the secret only to themselves, their company
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">- 219 -</span>
would not have been objected to. Such selfish
policy does not, however, accord with the social instinct
of bees, and these soon informed their companions of
the good fortune provided for them in an archipelago of
sugar islands. Day by day the swarms of these uninvited
visitors increased, until all legitimate customers
were beaten off; and the old dame had to see, not only
her hope of gain destroyed, but her stock of "goodies"
sensibly diminishing by the thefts of these brigands of
the air. She could not, or dare not attempt to, drive
the intruders away, so made diligent inquiry as to where
the robbers were harboured. Having traced them to
our establishment in Regent Street, she came to implore
of us to move the bees if possible, or she would have
to move her stall, and so lose her "connection" in the
"toffee" and "rock" trade. Wishing not to hinder
the poor woman in gaining her livelihood, we decided
on removing our bees into the country.</p>

<p>It is difficult to assign an exact limit to the distance
that bees will go in search of honey-yielding blossoms.
It has been proved by various experiments that they will
fly, say, five or six miles, if the supplies are scanty within
a shorter radius; but bees well understand that first of
all economies, the saving of time, and if they can find
forage near at hand, they prefer it. Hence, other
things being equal, the quantity of honey stored will be
in proportion to the contiguity of good pasturage. In
this way it is that the systematic removal of hives, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">- 220 -</span>
practised in many districts, has such a notable effect
on the honey harvest.</p>

<p>A novel sight for Londoners to witness occurred in
June, 1865. A swarm, having been ordered to be sent into
the country the following morning, was temporarily placed
on the leads at the back of our house, 149, Regent Street.
The sun shining hot on the hive, or some other cause,
induced the inmates to decamp. A passer-by called in to
inform us that some bees had arrested the progress of a
cab. We at once conjectured that they were those of
our missing swarm, the absence of which had previously
puzzled us not a little; so we sent our man with a straw-hive
to bring the truants back, which he succeeded in
doing, followed to the door by a crowd, who were
amazed at the sight of the "'oney-bees," as the Cockney
lads called them. Cabby had to be compensated for the
loss of his fare, for the affrighted passengers had left him
in a hurry, so that, altogether, no little commotion was
caused&mdash;a crowd so soon collects in London streets.
Among the lookers-on appears to have been a reporter
from the <i>Times</i> newspaper, for, two days afterwards, the
following paragraph appeared in the leading journal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">A Swarm of Bees in Burlington Street.</span>&mdash;On Wednesday
afternoon, about five o'clock, not a little excitement and
astonishment was caused in New Burlington Street, Regent Street,
by the circumstance of a swarm of bees alighting on a cab which
had just drawn up at the Burlington Restaurant. A man having
procured a hive, set to work, and, with assistance, succeeded in
securing the whole of the unexpected visitors, and took them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">- 221 -</span>
away. A swarm of bees is rarely, if ever, seen in the streets of
London, but it is not an uncommon occurrence for a swarm to
stray considerable distances."</p>
</div>

<p>The reporter was, of course, unaware that, instead of
the bees having "strayed" so far as he represented,
they were brought into London by rail, and had made
but a short flight from their temporary home.</p>

<p>During several years we kept bees in the Zoological
Gardens, Regent's Park, and have there frequently
taken full and handsome glasses of honey. The position
of our apiary was on the site now occupied by the
new monkey house. The Society promise to erect a
new building for an apiary in the course of the ensuing
summer. The visitors to the gardens found considerable,
interest in watching the bees in our glass hives, and are
now much disappointed at the absence of so entertaining
an exhibition. A collection of these hives are now
exhibited by the Acclimatisation Society of Great
Britain, with living bees in them, at the Fish Department
of the Royal Horticultural Gardens, South Kensington.</p>

<p>A gentleman residing in St. James's Place has, for
some considerable time past, kept bees in his garden,
there. He uses our improved cottage-hives, and his,
bee-keeping is decidedly successful, as he generally takes,
some fine glasses, of honey each season, besides, leaving
sufficient as winter store for the bees. For a London
situation, St. James's Place is a very favourable one;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">- 222 -</span>
the gardens behind the houses pleasantly face the Green
Park, so that the bees have an uninterrupted flight to
start with. They are also within easy range of the
richly-flowered gardens of Buckingham Palace and those
of the nobility and gentry who reside around the Parks.
To those, gardens, the bees of St. James's Place resort,
without waiting for any licence or certificate from the
royal and noble owners of the honey-yielding preserves.
Being within a short distance of our establishment, when
this gentleman's bees swarm, he generally sends to us for
assistance in hiving them.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of St. John's Wood and, indeed,
almost all the suburbs of London are favourable for the
production of honey. We mention St. John's Wood
because, from the fact of having kept bees there ourselves,
we are able to prove by experience that they do well
in that locality. We have several customers on nearly
all sides of the town, who have each had this year a
considerable surplus of honey in their "supers," after
leaving sufficient for the: bees themselves, in the lower or
stock hives.</p>

<p>We exhibited in our window, in the autumn of 1864,
a super of fine honey from the apiary of Mr. Shirley
Hibberd, the proprietor and editor of the <i>Gardeners'
Weekly Magazine</i>. It consisted of a box containing
20 lbs. nett weight of honey, and was produced at Stoke
Newington, only 3&frac14; miles from the General Post Office.</p>

<p>The <i>Times'</i> "Bee-Master," whose letters from Tunbridge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">- 223 -</span>
Wells have awakened so much interest in this
pleasing pursuit, also commissioned us to exhibit a
"super," produced under his own management in that
locality. Mr. S. B. Fox, at Exeter, had, upwards, of
400 lbs; of honey, of excellent quality, though one of his
apiaries is quite within the city.</p>

<p>The last has been an excellent honey-yielding season;
our own bees, at Dorking, Surrey, have produced us
large quantities, and the accounts from nearly all parts
of the country coincide in stating that the bees have, in
the years 1864 and 1865; enjoyed unusual opportunities
for accumulation. In not a few localities, the season of
1863 was even more abundant.</p>


<h3 id="WASPS">WASPS AND MOTHS.</h3>

<p>Bees, have few enemies more formidable, than wasps.
The most effectual method of checking their invasion of
hives is to have, as narrow an entrance, as the bees can
do with. If a stock be not, very weak in numbers, the
bees will be well able to guard a small aperture, and can
repel the attacks of those insidious, and merciless robbers.
On this account, the entrance to our cottager-hive,
as described at <a href="#Page_74">page 74</a>, may be used.</p>

<p>The bee-keeper is interested in preventing the increase
of wasps; it is, therefore, a good practice for him to
set a price on queen-wasps in the spring the death of
one of them at that time being equivalent to the destruction
of a whole nest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">- 224 -</span></p>

<p>Should nests be found in the neighbourhood of an
apiary, their annihilation must be accomplished, either
by blowing them up with gunpowder, an operation well
understood by most country, lads, or any, other effectual
method. The late Mr. Payne recommended, that a
small quantity of gas tar should be put into the mouth
of a wasps' nest, and if then covered with earth, the total
destruction of the wasps will be accomplished without
further trouble. But to use blazing straw for the purpose
is always dangerous in country districts. We have lately
heard of a very ingenious and successful mode of entrapping
and killing wasps. Place some sugar or strongly-sweetened
compound on the ground in a garden, and
place over it a square hand-glass, wedged up an inch or
so all round. On this glass, which should have an opening
at the apex, lodge another, but a sound one. The
wasps, attracted, by the sweets, will soon crowd under
the lower glass, and, when they have well feasted,
will ascend into the upper one; there, between the two,
they soon become scorched and perish by the heat of the
sun shining on the outer glass.</p>

<p>The season of 1864 was most productive for the increase
of these prime pests of the apiary, and many hives have
severely suffered by their depredations. When once
wasps in any number have gained an entrance into a
hive, the bees can seldom eject them, and the invaders
generally remain until they have freely regaled themselves
from the luscious store. They not only consume
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">- 225 -</span>
the honey, but cause a good deal of worry to the
legitimate inhabitants of the hive, as well as killing the
foremost defenders of it. Wasps being much superior
in strength, it requires at least three bees to master one
of them.</p>

<p>Having suffered loss in our own apiary from the
attacks of wasps, we feel it desirable to give a
detailed account of our troubles from that cause. A
Ligurian stock was besieged and worried by wasps
to such an extent, that the bees deserted it on the 5th
of September, 1864. Fortunately, the bees chose a
time for their departure just as we visited the apiary.
An unusual turmoil was heard in the hive, such as is experienced
at the time of swarming, and on immediately
examining the entrance, we observed that the bees were
quitting in tumultuous haste. The usual methods that
induce bees to settle were tried&mdash;amongst others, that
of throwing sand up into the air, so that it should fall
down amongst the bees on the wing; but they were
dispersed in disorder, and their flight extended over
three adjacent gardens. We only discovered the clustered
bees by diligent search, as the sequel will show.
Permission being asked of our next-door neighbour, we
searched his garden to see if our bees had alighted
there; but found that they had passed over. Making a
similar application to the owner of the garden adjoining,
we entered, having a straw hive in hand, but no bees
were there. After looking diligently all round, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">- 226 -</span>
climbing the wall, thereby gaining a view of the third
garden, we perceived in it unmistakable signs of an
unwonted commotion. The occupiers of the house were
intently looking at a particular part of the garden, and
there was a dust-pan and a key, with which the master
had been "tanging the bees," to induce them to settle.
We quickly made for the proper entrance to the garden,
and soon discovered our little wanderers clustered to
a large flower-vase. Our neighbours, however, were
sadly disappointed of their prize, for the gardener had
hastily been dispatched into the town to purchase a hive
for the welcome colonists. In depriving our neighbours
of a so unexpected and cheaply-acquired treasure, we
could sympathise with their regret, having been much
disheartened half an hour before at our own loss; but,
of course, we could do no other than claim our own
bees. We gladly agreed to defray the expense of the
straw hive that had been purchased for the sake of our
truant swarm. After brushing the bees into the hive,
and leaving it propped up with a stick, in order that the
stray ones might join, we returned home for an hour or
so, to give them time to settle. Judge of our vexation
when, on returning to fetch the hive home, we found that
the refractory creatures had again taken flight, and that
all the work was to do over again. The wasps were
not to blame for this second flight of the Ligurians; we
judged that the swarm had been disturbed by visits from
a colony of bees that we discovered were living the life
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">- 227 -</span>
of outlaws under the roof of an adjoining house.
Although much disheartened and perplexed, we at once
renewed our search, and, upon inquiry, found that the
missing bees had taken a southerly course across the
turnpike road, and it was therefore necessary to ask
permission to search the gardens of the houses opposite.
From one of these we observed, on looking through the
hedge, that the inhabitants of the' next house were on
the <i>qui vive</i>. On inquiring whether they had seen a
colony of bees, the wary old dame replied that she "had
no bees but her own," and added that "they were very
much excited." Having asked permission to go through
the hedge to look at her bees, we soon discovered our
Ligurians on the top of the old lady's bee-house. There
was no difficulty in identifying our own bees; their yellow
rings were as good as a private mark. Quickly hiving
the swarm, we took them home, and replaced them in
the hive they had quitted. It was almost destitute of
honey; but by liberal feeding, and lessening the entrance
so that only one bee at a time could find ingress or
egress, we succeeded in inducing them to rest in their
old home. Thus nearly half a day's exertion was
needed to save a fine colony, which would otherwise
have been utterly lost by the power of the relentless
wasps.</p>

<p>Much watchfulness is needed to prevent the loss of
swarms, and the foregoing incident may serve to suggest
the necessity of having hives so located as to be constantly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">- 228 -</span>
within view, either from the dining-room, or of those
whose duties oblige them to be near the apiary. If we
had not happened to be at hand at the moment this colony
started, it would have been irretrievably lost to us. Many
swarms and colonies are lost, simply because the departure
takes place without anyone witnessing it. Let us
hope that runaway bees may always fall into the hands
of those who are as capable of taking care of them as
our neighbours appeared to be on the occasion we have
described.</p>

<p>Other formidable enemies of bees are moths. These
insects are creatures of the night, as the wasps are of
the day, and they make their way into the hives under
cover of darkness, in spite of the bee-sentinels. They
deposit their eggs in any crevices in or near the hive
that they can find. There the warmth of the hive, or of
the sheltered situation, causes the eggs speedily, to hatch,
and then the maggots soon work their way to the comb
and larv&aelig; food, which they greedily devour, thereby
often bringing about the gradual but certain destruction
of the whole community of bees. The best method
of, keeping moths outside the hives is to lessen the
entrance, as before alluded to. Also, in the early
spring, the hives should be lifted from their floor-boards,
which must then be made thoroughly clean; and all
crevices and corners about the hive and stand should be
scraped, so as to get rid of all eggs of moths and other
insects before the warm weather hatches them or enables
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">- 229 -</span>
them to do mischief. The bee-moth is not so troublesome
in England as it is in America and some parts
of Germany; but still its encroachments should be
carefully guarded against in this country, for if not,
it may easily increase to a very serious extent. In
the season of 1865, wasps were as few as they were
numerous the preceding year; their paucity was attributable
either to frosts in May or to heavy rains
in June, which destroyed them in their nests. In
general, wasps are great depredators of wall-fruit, but,
in the autumn before mentioned, the bees occupied the
wasps' foraging-ground. Perhaps never in the memory
of bee-keepers did bees feast upon fruit in the same
manner. Various reasons have been assigned for this
unusual occurrence; some thought that as there were so
few wasps the bees were unmolested, and enjoyed the
saccharine matter in the fruit without let or hindrance&mdash;for
bees are about as partial to the company of wasps
as mice are to that of rats. Other bee-keepers remarked
the sudden and early termination of the honey-gathering,
and conjectured that the bees, being anxious
to make up their winter store, endeavoured to bring
home nectar from the fruit because the weather was
unusually fine. There was one feature which is worth
remarking: as far as our observation extended, the
bees did not, like the wasps, break the skin of sound
fruit, but were satisfied with lapping the juice of the
ripe fruit that had the skin already broken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">- 230 -</span></p>

<p>An unusual amount of robbing and fighting occurred
in the autumn of 1865; the weather remaining fine and
warm, and the honey having all but ceased in the flowers,
the bees began to assail each other's hives, as usual,
the strong attacking the weak. In most years, this
spirit of depredation exists, and the bee-keeper should
be on his guard not to tempt the avarice of bees' by
exposing honey, either in the comb or liquid, and also to
be very tardy of opening bar and frame hives at this time
of year. If needful to do so (soon after sunrise is the
safest, because there will be few bees about), take
the hive to a quiet corner of the garden, many yards
away from the other hives, and do what is requisite
speedily, so as not to expose the honey to the scent of a
host of robbers, who will most unceremoniously pillage,
and cause a terrible commotion. This caution will also
be necessary to be kept in view when removing supers.
In fact, many liberties that may be taken with bees when
they are busy in the gathering season will most wofully
disturb an apiary in August or September; and this
plundering spirit may exist even in October.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> In the spring of the year, great care is also needful as regards
feeding and in opening hives.</p>

</div>


<h3 id="DRAINING_HONEY">DRAINING HONEY FROM THE COMBS.</h3>

<p>Those of our readers who prefer eating "run honey"
to honey in the comb may be glad of some instruction
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">- 231 -</span>
as to the best way of separating the two. For this purpose,
it is better to let the honey run without squeezing,
in order to preserve both its transparency and flavour.</p>

<p>Take a sharp knife, and slice the combs on both sides,
keeping the knife parallel with the partition wall, so that
every cell may be laid open. Place these broken combs
in a sieve, or on a piece of muslin stretched across and
tied round the opening of a pan or large-mouthed jar.
Allow the honey to flow out of the combs spontaneously,
and reserve the squeezing process for a separate jar, so
that the honey of the first drained jar may be perfectly
pure, both in appearance and flavour. That which has
pressure put on it will be waxy in flavour and thick.
Some persons recommend that the opened combs be
placed in the sun, as the heat will cause the honey to run
more freely. The great disadvantage of this is, the
temptation the honey offers to bees, who will be eager
to gain a share. Honey, whilst in the combs, keeps
remarkably well when left in the supers; if cut out, the
combs should be folded in writing-paper, and sealed up,
so as to effectually prevent the free entrance of air: they
should then be placed in a warm, dry closet.</p>

<p>Honey, like most vegetable products, should be fresh
every year. It may easily be kept from one season to
another; but when kept beyond that time, unless very
carefully stored in a warm temperature, it will crystallize
in the comb, and it is liable to ferment when in jars
separated from the comb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">- 232 -</span></p>


<h3 id="DISEASES">DISEASES OF BEES.</h3>

<p>Dysentery is a disease produced either by long confinement,
by dampness, or by feeding in the winter. The
first thing bees do when disturbed is to fill themselves
with food, so that in winter weather, when they cannot
get out to void their f&aelig;ces, hives should not be meddled
with, otherwise the complaint may be brought on. It is
also engendered in many instances by the state of the
weather in winter months, and is indicated by the yellow
colour of the excrement, and by its being voided upon
the floors and at the entrance of the hives, which bees
in a healthy state generally keep clean. All, that can
be done for them when affected is to well clean or
to change the floor-board, and so produce cleanliness.
Having made some remarks on this disease at <a href="#Page_214">page 214</a>,
in connection with bees sent to Australia, we will pass
on to the more formidable, but happily less common,
malady of "foul brood."</p>

<p>This disease does not attack the bees themselves, but
affects the larv&aelig;, by causing them to putrefy in the cells,
thus destroying all hope of the rising generation. Bees
are exceedingly fond of their young, and are greatly
dispirited when their hives are in this plight. In common
with most pestilential disorders, no satisfactory cause is
assigned for its first appearance. Some apiarians contend,
that "foul brood" is another name for chilled,
brood; others, that the queen, by a freak of nature,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">- 233 -</span>
deposits some of her eggs the wrong way upwards,
and that these putrefy in the cells and contaminate the
others. Whatever may be the origin, one thing is very
certain, "it is catching;" there is, however, in the circumstance
of the adult bees and of those about emerging
from the cells not being injuriously affected thereby,
a great help to its eradication, as will presently be
shown.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of foul brood&mdash;one is moist and
f&#339;tid, the other is dry and not contagious, the brood
merely drying up in the cells, and, from its partial character,
is probably within the power of the bees themselves
to overcome. In the former, instead of drying up,
the brood remains dark and slimy in the cells, and
emits a most unpleasant odour, perceptible at some distance
from the hive.</p>

<p>In the year 1848, Pastor Dzierzon lost a large number
of stocks from this disease; he, however, was enabled to
banish it from his apiary, and communicated to a
German bee-journal very wholesome advice, which
Mr. Langstroth quotes, and from which we make an
extract:&mdash;"When the malady makes its appearance in
only two or three of the colonies, and is discovered early
(which may readily be done in hives having movable
combs), it can be arrested and cured without damage or
diminution of profit. <i>To prevent the disease from spreading
in a colony, there is no more reliable and efficient process</i>
<span class="allsmcap">THAN TO STOP THE PRODUCTION OF BROOD</span>; for where no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">- 234 -</span>
brood exists, none can perish or putrefy. The disease
is thus deprived both of its aliment and its subjects.
The healthy brood will mature and emerge in due time,
and the putrid matter remaining in a few cells will dry
up and be removed by the workers. All this will certainly
result <i>from a well-timed removal of the queen</i> from
such colonies. If such removal becomes necessary in
the spring or early part of the summer, a supernumerary
queen is thereby obtained, by means of which an artificial
colony may be started, which will certainly be healthy if
the bees and brood used be taken from healthy colonies.
Should the removal be made in the latter part of summer,
the useless production of brood will at once be stopped
and an unnecessary consumption of honey prevented.
Thus, in either case, we are gainers by the operation."</p>

<p>In cases where the disease assumes a more malignant
character&mdash;in other words, "has got ahead," through
"not being nipped in the bud,"&mdash;it will be well to take
notice of another quotation from Mr. Langstroth's book:&mdash;"In
the spring or summer, when the weather is fine
and pasturage abounds, the following cure is recommended
by a German apiarian:&mdash;'Drive out the bees
into any clean, hive, and shut them up in a dark place
without food for twenty-four hours; prepare for them a
clean hive, properly fitted up with comb from healthy
colonies; transfer the bees into it, and confine them two
days longer, feeding them with pure honey.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Woodbury's apiary was severely attacked by this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">- 235 -</span>
disease in the spring and summer of 1863. The writer
happened to be on a visit to him at this juncture,
and witnessed him withdrawing infected combs from
hives that were literally masses of corruption, the brood-cells
of which, on being opened with a pointed instrument,
revealed the dark brown slimy matter before
alluded to, and from which arose a most unpleasant
smell. Mr. Woodbury communicated to the <i>Journal
of Horticulture</i>, of July 21, 1863, an exact and graphic
account of his misfortunes, headed "A Dwindling
Apiary." Finding that the removal of the putrid matter
must be simultaneously effected and the bees driven
out and placed in hives that had undergone a complete
purification, Mr. Woodbury set about endeavouring to
accomplish his object, and was so far successful, that he
was able to furnish an article to the before-named
journal of August 4th, under the more cheerful title of
"Convalescent," in which he says: "First, let me
indorse the opinions both of Dzierzon and Rothe, that,
except under very especial circumstances, it is unadvisable
to attempt the cure of a foul-breeding stock:
better, far better, to consign its inhabitants to the brimstone
pit; the hive itself, if a straw one, to the flames;
the comb to the melting pot; and appropriate the
honey to any purpose, except that of feeding bees."</p>

<p>Mr. Woodbury further says: "Before starting, it was
requisite to insure the transfer of the bees to unpolluted
hives; and here I found that Dzierzon declares that every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">- 236 -</span>
hive that has contained a foul-breeding colony should be
exposed to the sun and air for two years before being
re-stocked. In my own case, this was simply impossible,
and I therefore adopted the practice of another German
writer on the subject, viz., to scrape out the hive very
carefully, wash it all over with a saturated solution of
chloride of lime, keeping it closely shut up for twenty-four
hours, and then, after thoroughly washing it with
clean water, exposing it to the sun and air until the
smell of the disinfectant had passed off. This method
has the advantage of enabling one to use a wooden hive
again after a lapse of a couple of days, and is, I believe,
thoroughly effectual."</p>

<p>Mr. Woodbury then captured the queen, secured her
in a "cage," and placed her in a clean empty hive; all
her bees were brushed from their combs into it as rapidly
as possible, in order to prevent their carrying much of
the infected honey with them, whilst the combs themselves
were set draining out of the bees' reach, and consigned
as quickly as possible to the melting pot. After the
lapse of three or four days, the queen (still imprisoned)
and bees were again transferred to another clean hive,
furnished with a few pure combs, and in this they were
suffered to remain, their queen being released in a day
or two, as soon as they appeared contentedly settled.
Mr. Woodbury gives another important hint that operations
of this kind with tainted combs should be performed
out of reach of robber-bees from adjacent hives, lest they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">- 237 -</span>
should carry the infection to their respective houses. By
the before-mentioned process, Mr. Woodbury succeeded
in completely extirpating foul brood from his apiary in
1863, and has had no return of it since. English apiarian
writers have made so little allusion to this disorder, that
some of our older bee-keepers contend that modern hives
and foreign bees have something to do with bringing it
about. To show that the disease made its appearance
in former days, there is a chapter on this subject in
Bonner's "Bee-Keeper's Companion," published at
Berwick, in 1798, entitled, "An uncommon Disaster which
sometimes, though rarely, happens to Bees," which Mr.
Woodbury quotes at length in the <i>Journal of Horticulture</i>.
Bonner, after recounting therein his observations of the
dwindling state of his apiary for which he could not
account, says: "He saw plainly that the young were all
going backward in the cells, and that he looked down
between the combs, but was unable to proceed for the
stench that the rotten maggots produced." Mr. Langstroth
writes that "Aristotle speaks of a disease which
was accompanied with a disgusting smell, so that there
is reason to believe that foul brood was known two
thousand years ago."</p>

<p>When we take into consideration how sorely our
farmers are perplexed by the cattle plague, known as
the rinderpest, concerning which so many conflicting
opinions exist (and the same may be said of the recommendations
for its cure), can we wonder that our little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">- 238 -</span>
favourites should occasionally be liable to disorders of
this sort, which puzzle even experienced bee-keepers?
In the hope of allaying unnecessary alarm, we would
just add that "foul brood" is not a very general complaint,
and, so far as our observation extends, has been
most fatal in large experimental apiaries, where extensive
propagation has necessarily had to be pushed forward.
With the experience and advice already gained,
this disorder may now be said to be deprived of its terrors.</p>


<h3 id="GENERAL_REMARKS">GENERAL REMARKS.</h3>

<p>Every bee-keeper should be a book-keeper; that is, so
far as to have a permanent record of the events of the
apiary and the fortunes of his bees. A book similar to a
tradesman's journal would be very suitable for the purpose.
In it he should note down the date of the first
swarm of the season especially, and those of the other
swarms also; and in autumn, the quantity of honey
taken from each hive should be entered, with remarks
on the probable size of the various stocks. These particulars
will not only be interesting for the bee-keeper to
turn to in winter, but will be of practical service in enabling
him to know the exact age and probable strength
of each stock. The bee-book may also be contrived to
show the total amount of honey that the bees have produced
for their owner, and the net money profit of the
apiary. A simple and clear account like this&mdash;provided,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">- 239 -</span>
by the bye, that it does show a satisfactory balance&mdash;will
be very useful for inducing cottagers and farm-labourers
to start bee-keeping. Nothing like ocular demonstration
for this class. The "humane" apiarian will reason
with them in vain, until he shows them a monster "skep"
of honey, and mentions the price that it will fetch in the
market When convinced that the depriving system
will pay, the cottager will gladly adopt it.</p>

<p>A writer in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> gives the following
good advice:&mdash;"Don't bore the cottager with long lectures;
don't heap upon him many little books; but give
him a hive of the best construction, show him the
management, and then <i>buy his honey;</i> <i>buy</i> all he brings,
even though you should have to give the surplus to some
gardenless widow. But only buy such as comes from
an improved hive&mdash;and you cannot easily be deceived in
this,&mdash;one which preserves the bees and betters the
honey. Then, when you pay him, you may read to him,
if you will, the wise rules of old Butler, <i>exempli
grati&acirc;</i>:&mdash;</p>

but, softly moving by, thy hand before thy face, gently put them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">- 240 -</span>
by; and, lastly, thou must be no stranger to them. In a word
(or rather in five words), be chaste, sweet, sober, quiet, familiar;

<p>Allusion having been made to the profit that may be
gained by the judicious management of bees, we will illustrate
that point by relating an anecdote of a certain French
<i>cur&eacute;</i>.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> It is one which may be suggestive to some of the
rural clergy in this country, who might almost as easily
keep an apiary as they do a garden or an orchard.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> This story, in a disguised form, or, as the writer would say,
an improved form, was quoted in the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> some
time ago. In transforming the bee-keeping <i>cur&eacute;</i> into an English
clergyman, the effect was cleverly enhanced, especially as to
the dismay of the decorous English prelate in hearing that his
poor brother in the Church had turned "manufacturer;" but
then the <i>vraisemblance</i> of the story, as we have it, was destroyed.</p>

</div>

<p>A good French bishop, in paying his annual visit to
his clergy, was very much afflicted by the representations
they made to him of their extreme poverty, which,
indeed, the appearance of their houses and families corroborated.
Deploring the sad state of things which had
reduced them to such a condition, he arrived at the house
of a curate, who, living amongst a poorer set of parishioners
than any he had yet visited, would, he feared, be
in a still more woful plight than the rest. Contrary,
however, to his expectations, he found the appearance of
this remote parsonage to be superior to those he had
already visited. Everything about the house wore the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">- 241 -</span>
aspect of comfort and plenty. The good bishop was
amazed. "How is this, my friend?" said he; "you are
the first pastor I have met with having a cheerful face
and a plentiful board! Have you any income independent
of your cure?" "Yes, sire," said the pastor,
"I have: my family would starve on the pittance I receive
from the poor people that I instruct. If you will walk
into the garden, I will show you the stock that yields me
such excellent interest." On going into the garden, he
showed the bishop a long range of bee-hives. "There,"
said he, "is the bank from which I draw an annual
dividend, and it is one that never stops payment." His
harvest of honey enabled him almost to dispense with
the use of sugar, leaving him a considerable quantify
for disposal in the market; of the coarser portions he
made a tolerable substitute for wine, and the sale of the
wax nearly paid his shoemaker's bill. Ever afterwards,
when any of the clergy complained to the bishop of
poverty, he would say to them, "Keep bees! keep
bees!" In this succinct advice&mdash;extending it to laity
as well as clergy in rural districts&mdash;we heartily join,
believing that in this country a ten-fold greater number
of hives might be successfully kept than are now
established.</p>

<p>In a very practical sense, the oft-repeated lines of Gray
are strictly true:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="p0">An apiary in the garden of every village clergyman
would afford the means of economising this unclaimed
bounty of Providence.</p>

<p>An amusing, instance of the fondness of bears for
honey is related by a Muscovite ambassador to Rome, in
the "Feminine Monarchie; written out of Experience by
Charles Butler. Printed in the Year 1609,"&mdash;a quaint,
but sensible work:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A neighbour of mine (saith he), in searching in the woods for
honey, slipped down into a great hollow tree, and there sunk into
a lake of honey up to the breast; where&mdash;when he had stuck fast
two days, calling and crying out in vain for help, because nobody
in the meanwhile, came nigh that solitary place&mdash;at length, when
he was out of all hope of life, he was strangely delivered by the
means of a great bear, which, coming thither about the same
business that he did, and smelling the honey, stirred with his
striving, clambered up to the top of the tree, and then began to
lower himself down backwards into it. The man bethinking
himself, and knowing that the worst was but death&mdash;which in
that place he was sure of&mdash;beclipt the bear fast with both his
hands about the loins, and withal made an outcry as loud as he
could. The bear being thus suddenly affrighted, what with the
handling and what with the noise, made-up again with all
speed possible. The man held, and the bear pulled, until, with
main force, he had drawn him out of the mire; and then being let
go, away he trots, more afeared than hurt, leaving the smeared
swain in joyful fear."</p>

<p>Bees may be very inexpensively and profitably kept
in the cottager's hive (see <a href="#Page_80">page 80</a>), which will be found
a very productive one. It is true that it has not the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">- 243 -</span>
appliances of windows and bell-glasses; for the cottager
is not supposed so much to care for his hives as a source
of amusement; his object in bee-keeping is simply the
profit it may bring. For those of our readers who wish
to have united the facility, of observing the bees with that
of the plentiful production of honey, we would especially
recommend the improved cottage hive, described at
<a href="#Page_69">page 69</a>. If inclined to go to a little further expense, the
hives described at pages <a href="#Page_51">51</a>, <a href="#Page_62">62</a>, <a href="#Page_77">77</a>, and <a href="#Page_84">84</a>, all afford
constant opportunity for inspection of the bees, and allow
of their working freely in the most natural manner. The
Stewarton hive (<a href="#Page_109">page 109</a>) is also a favourite with those
who give the preference to honey, stored in boxes,
although the opportunities for observation are not so
great as with some others.</p>

<p>There are few hobbies which cost so little outlay as
the keeping of bees! Once the "plant" of hives is
purchased, there is little, if any, additional expense, and
always a probability of a fair return. If honey be
obtainable, the bees will find it; they work for nothing,
and provide themselves, with sustenance, requiring only
a very little labour from their keepers, and that labour
of a pleasing and instructive, kind.</p>

<p>To the advanced and skilful apiarian we would
especially commend the use of the bar and frame hives.
With these, as we have attempted to show, the bee-keeper
has a full command over his hives and bees.
Many mistakes, it is true, have been made by uninitiated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">- 244 -</span>
bee-keepers in using the more elaborate hives. Being
struck with the remarkable facilities afforded by these
superior hives for the extraction of any one comb, and,
perhaps, fascinated with their easy sway over so highly-organized
a community, these new-fangled bee-keepers
have acquired a habit of perpetually and incautiously
meddling with the bees. The inevitable results in such
cases are, distress to the bees, impoverishment of the
stocks, and loss and vexation to the over-zealous apiarian.
All these things may be avoided, if it is remembered
that there are first steps in bee-keeping, as well as in
chemistry, croquet, or cricket. In bee-keeping, as in
floriculture, it is a great point to know when to "let well
alone." There is no florist, however anxious for a prize,
who would be continually pulling up his plants to see
how their roots were growing. Doubtless, the full control
which the bars and frames afford over the inmost
recesses of the hives is a great temptation to the bee-keeper;
but if he yields too readily to it, he will imperil
his chance of profit and deprive himself of that continuous
source of interest which a judicious apiarian
always enjoys.</p>

<p>Many persons who are well-informed on most subjects
are extraordinarily ignorant of the natural history
of bees and the economy of the bee-hive. Perhaps
we might venture to suggest that more pains should be
taken at schools, or by parents, to inform young persons
on this, in connexion with kindred subjects. As an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">- 245 -</span>
amusing illustration of the ignorance referred to, we
transcribe an order we received a short time since from a
seminary in the north of England. The young gentleman
thus writes:&mdash;"Master &mdash;&mdash; presents his compliments
to Messrs. Neighbour, and begs they will send him a
swarm of bees; he encloses <i>six postage stamps</i>, and
hopes they will send him a <i>good</i> swarm." This embryo
naturalist was evidently of a mercantile turn, and had a
mind to buy in the cheapest market, for in a postscript he
adds:&mdash;"Please let it be fourpence, if you can!" We
need scarcely say that, in reply, we endeavoured to
enlighten our juvenile correspondent as to what constituted
a swarm of bees, and returned the stamps, with
our thanks.</p>

<p>Much superstition has existed, and, in some quarters,
still exists, among the poor respecting bees. If a death
occurs in the family of the bee-owner, these superstitious
folk consider it needful to make the bees aware of the
bereavement by "waking" them; that is, by giving a
few raps at the entrance, and audibly announcing the
circumstance. If this be not done, "no luck," say they,
will come of the bees the following season. Last summer,
even near the metropolis, we heard a cottager
bemoaning to his neighbour "his bad luck with his bees,"
when the other replied, "Ah! no wonder; you never
'waked' your bees when your wife died; what can you
expect if you omit such needful duty?" In many parts of
France, as well as here, it is a custom on such occasions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">- 246 -</span>
to put the bees into mourning, by placing black crape or
some such material round the hives. Bees also receive
intelligence when a marriage or a christening takes
place: in these cases, the hives are draped with red
cloth. In fact, it is considered an essential element of
"good luck" to inform the bees of any remarkable
circumstance that occurs in the family of the bee-keeper.
How would these good people manage with the newly-imported
foreign bees, for they can hardly be expected
to have learned our "lingo"? This difficulty is, however,
not "likely" to be experienced, for it is to be hoped that
intelligent bee-keepers do not believe in such nonsense.
Fancy a man in this nineteenth century haranguing his
bees after the above-mentioned fashion! Mr. Langstroth
says that "some superstitious folk in America assert that
the bees sometimes take the loss of their master so much to
heart as to alight upon the coffin whenever it is exposed."
A clergyman told him that he attended a funeral where,
as soon as the coffin was brought from the house, the bees
gathered on it so much as to excite alarm. Some
years after this occurrence, being engaged in varnishing
a table, the bees alighted upon it in such numbers
as to convince the clergyman that love of the varnish on
the outside, rather than any respect for the deceased
within, was the occasion of their conduct at the funeral.
Mr. Langstroth adds: "How many superstitions, believed
even by intelligent persons, might be as easily
explained, if it were possible to ascertain as fully all the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">- 247 -</span>
facts connected with them?" Another infatuation is,
that you should on no account part with your bees for
silver money&mdash;only for <i>gold</i>. This is so far sensible,
that it ensures a respectable price. Certain credulous
bee-keepers cannot, on any account; be induced to part
with their bees for money; they will <i>barter</i>, but not <i>sell</i>,&mdash;to
sell bees is, in their view, to lay themselves open to
evil fortune. If these apprehensions are correct, our
punishment will be a severe one, for we have been
great offenders in that way, and seem likely to go on
sinning.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to add that, with the increase
of education, such superstitions and fancies are becoming
less and less, and will soon, it is hoped, be ranked
amongst the follies of bygone days.</p>

<p>The culture of bees would be greatly promoted if a
knowledge of it were considered necessary as one of the
regular qualifications of a gardener. So little time is
needed to gain the skill requisite for the tendance of an
apiary, that it seems only reasonable to expect it of a
well-taught gardener, and he should feel a pleasure in
the circumstance of its forming a part of his duties. In
Germany, where a country gentleman's table is kept
constantly supplied with fresh honey, the gardeners are
expected to understand the management of hives; and
in Bavaria, modern bee-culture is taught in the colleges
to all the horticultural students. Travellers in Switzerland
will call to mind the almost invariable practice of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">- 248 -</span>
placing new honey on the breakfast tables at hotels in
that country.</p>

<p>Some writers on bee-culture attach much importance
to the particular position in which an apiary stands, and
the aspect towards which it faces. A southern, or rather
a south-eastern aspect, is the one which we have already
recommended. Our reason for this preference is, that
we deem it very important for the bees to have the first
of the morning sun. Bees are early risers, and should
have every inducement given them for the maintenance
of so excellent a practice. A few years since, many
strong opinions were expressed in favour of a northern
aspect for hives. The chief reason given for those
opinions, though very plausible, appears to us to be a
very partial and inadequate one. It was said that, when
the hives face the south, the bees may, like the incautious
swallow in the fable, be tempted to fly abroad in the
transient winter sunshine, and then perish in the freezing
atmosphere when a passing cloud intervenes. But it is
a very easy matter, if considered needful, to screen the
entrance by fixing up matting so as to intercept the rays
of the sun. At our own apiary we make no alteration
in winter, under the belief that the bees will take care of
themselves and that they seldom venture out when the
weather is unsuitable.</p>

<p>With hives exposed in the open garden, it is a good
practice to wind hay-bands round them in frosty weather,
as such a protection enables the bees to resist the cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">- 249 -</span></p>

<p>When a thaw occurs, everything, both in and out of
doors, has a great deal of dampness about it. The
combs of a hive are not exempt from this, so that it is
advisable to have slight upward ventilation in winter.
Holes the size of a pin's head allow of the escape of a
good deal of bad air, which is generated by the exhalations
of the bees, as well as by the dampness before
referred to. These holes, being small, do not create sufficient
draught through the hives to be pernicious; if closed
up by propolis, they are readily reopened with a pin. With
wooden hives in winter, a bell-glass is often found to be
useful; it should be placed over the hole in the crown-board,
with a zinc trough to receive the condensed moisture.</p>

<p>In summer, bees do much towards ventilating their
own stock-hives. The observant apiarian will not fail to
remark how, on a warm day, several of the little creatures
will stand at the entrance, with their abdomens
sightly raised and their twinkling wings in rapid
motion, producing a current of air inwards; while
another set are engaged in like manner, driving the bad
air out, so that a supply of pure oxygen is conveyed to
the crowded inmates. In this fanning operation their
wings vibrate with such rapidity, that their shape is as
indistinct as are the spokes of a wheel when revolving in
rapid centrifugal motion.</p>

<p>This important office entails great physical exertion
on the part of the bees, and they relieve each other in
detachments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">- 250 -</span></p>

<p>Fine colonies are sometimes destroyed by the entrance-way
becoming stopped by some impediment or other,
and care is requisite to keep a watch, that so fatal a
catastrophe does not happen, because the bees (<i>unless
where very ample ventilation is given</i>), excited by their
imprisonment, make matters worse, by raising the temperature
of their hive to such a pitch, that the combs
melt from their foundations, and the bees themselves are
suffocated, presenting, alas! a most woful spectacle to
witness.</p>

<p>We give this hint because, having ourselves suffered
from a similar cause when workmen have been employed
in the vicinity of hives, these gentlemen, thoughtless
of the welfare of the bees, but most careful of their
own convenience, placed a piece of wood across, or
otherwise stopped, the entrances, to prevent the bees
coming out. In <i>summer weather</i> a very short time of
confinement in a close hive suffices to complete the work
of desolation; but should the bee-keeper's attention be
drawn to such a state of things, he must immediately
raise the hive from its floor-board, and let the poor
bees have all the air possible, leaving them thus exposed
for the purpose of affording them a chance of revival.
When bees are likely to incommode those whose duties
temporarily oblige them to be near the entrances, it is
better to move the hives a few paces (for less loss will
be experienced), or else let the workmen cover their
faces with net. The foregoing remarks more particularly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">- 251 -</span>
apply to the summer season. In winter or in
the spring, when the weather is cool and the bees are
not so numerous, hives may be shut up even for a day
or so without much <i>ventilation</i>, and but little harm will
arise therefrom.</p>

<p>When we send away stocks or swarms, we are always
careful to pack them so as to allow of a full current of air,
in order that they may travel even in the hottest weather.</p>

<p>Some bee-keepers find an adapting-board convenient
for placing underneath straw supers, as it facilitates their
removal. These boards are made of mahogany half
an inch thick, with a hole in the centre corresponding
with that in the stock-hive. We do not consider it necessary
to fix cross sticks in the straw stock-hives, as is
frequently done; but if the apiarian prefers to have his
hives so furnished, there is no serious objection to it.
These observations refer to our cottager's hive
(<a href="#Page_80">page 80</a>).</p>

<p>There is another little matter of detail that should be
named here; that is, the necessity of the bee-keeper
always having a common hive in readiness near the
bees, so as to be able to secure any swarm which may
unexpectedly start.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here our pleasant task must close. We trust that all
information has been given that is needful to enable the
practical bee-keeper to begin business and the scientific
apiarian to extend his observations. By way of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">- 252 -</span>
illustrating the two characters combined, we will quote

<p>Messrs. Neighbour's Apiary consists of a large glass case,
with parts of the sides covered with perforated zinc for the sake
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">- 256 -</span>
of ventilation. This apiary contains three hives: first, Neighbour's
Ventilating Box-Hive, containing from 15,600 to 20,000
bees, which were hived on the 30th of April of the present year, the
day before that of the opening of the Great Exhibition; Neighbour's
Observatory Glass-Hive, containing about the same
number as the box-hive; and a two-storied square box-hive,
with sloping roof. From this latter, however, the bees decamped
within a week after they had been hived, owing to some disturbance,
or perhaps to the dislike taken by the bees to their new
habitation. The Ventilating Box-Hive is in shape square, having
windows and shutters. The entrance is at the back, enabling the
bees to go to Kensington Gardens, or other resorts, when they
please. Above the wooden box is placed a bell-glass, into which
the bees ascend to work through a circular opening in the top of
the square box. In the top of the bell-glass is an aperture, through
which is inserted a tubular trunk of perforated zinc to take off the
moisture from within. The Observatory Hive is of glass, with a
superior crystal compartment, an opening being formed between
the two; the bees are at present forming a comb in this upper
glass, which affords a very interesting sight, as, generally speaking,
the bees are in such a cluster when at work, that one can
scarcely view their mathematically-formed cells. A straw cover
is suspended over the upper compartment by a rope over a pulley,
which cover is raised up by the attendant at pleasure. The larger
or bottom compartment rests on a wooden floor, which has a
circular groove sinking therein to receive the bell-glass. A landing
place projecting, as usual, with sunken way, to enable the
bees to pass in and out of their habitation, completes this contrivance.</p>

<p>In addition to Mr. Neighbour's Crystal Apiary, he also
exhibits a Cottager's Straw Hive, Taylor's Amateur Bee-Hive,
a Glass Hive, Nutt's Patent Collateral Hive, the Ladies'
Observatory Hive, Neighbour's Improved Cottage Hive, and
Payne's Cottage Hive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">- 257 -</span></p>

<p>The Cottager's Hive is simply that of the form we find in use
in most parts of the country, where the industrious cottagers or
their wives, by a little attention to their interesting little labourers,
are enabled to add something to their usually scanty earnings.
This kind of hive is usually made of straw, resting on a circular
wooden board, with part of the board or floor projecting in front
as a landing-place for the bees, which enter under the edge of the
straw by means of a sinking in the floor.</p>

<p>Taylor's Amateur's Bee-Hive consists of three small square
boxes, one above another, with a roof over the top story, the ventilation
being effected by perforations under the eaves; each side
of every story has a window and shutter. The landing-place is
in front of the bottom story, and the entrance to the hive is a
long slit about three-quarters of an inch high.</p>

<p>The Glass Hive, or Ladies' Observatory Hive, is similar to that
in which the bees are at work in Mr. Neighbour's Apiary
already mentioned, but on account of the number of bees at work
therein, and the extent of comb already effected, the interior
perches cannot be seen. These wooden perches are arranged in
parallel lines, leaving a space next the glass all round, the whole
being framed together with a bar at right angles, and resting on
an upright support in the middle.</p>

<p>The Improved Cottage Hive of the same exhibitor consists of a
straw circular lower compartment, having windows and outside
shutters. A thermometer is placed just inside one of the windows.
The floor is of wood, with a landing-place and sunken way, as
already mentioned in some of the other hives. In the top, which
is also of wood, are three circular perforations, each of about two
inches in diameter, above which are placed as many bell-glasses.
There is a small hole in the top of each of the glasses, through which
a perforated tubular trunk is inserted for the sake of taking off the
moisture from the interior of the hive. Within the glass is a feeding-trough
of zinc, circular in shape, with a floating perforated floor,
on which the bees alight, and in the winter season regale themselves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">- 258 -</span>
with the honey which is found in the various perforations,
as it floats up to the level of the honey contained in the small
filling-trough, through which the honey, or beer and sugar, is
poured. The glasses are covered with a straw cap, removable at
pleasure.</p>

<p>Messrs. Neighbour's contributions are completed with tin
perforated fumigators, by the use of which the bees are stupefied
for a while, when required to be moved from one hive to another,
and specimens of honey and honeycomb of the season 1850.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>From the "Express."</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bees and Bee-Hives.</span>&mdash;In the North-East Gallery, directly
under the Transept, are arranged, by Messrs. Neighbour, of
Holborn, several descriptions of bee-hives, which it will be interesting
to many of our readers to examine, as this branch of
rural economy is claiming much general and deserved attention
throughout the country. The novelty of these hives consists in
the facilities that are afforded in taking therefrom, at any time of
the gathering season, the purest honey, without destroying or
even injuring the bees, thus humanely superseding the barbarous
and hateful system of murdering these interesting insects to obtain
the produce of their industry.</p>

<p>Immediately adjoining the group of untenanted bee-hives may
be observed living hives with the bees most industriously at work.
These useful little creatures have been highly honoured by the
Executive Committee, for of all the animal workers that contribute
to the interest of the Exhibition, they alone are allowed
therein to display their matchless ingenuity and skill. By a
simple contrivance, the bees are allowed egress and ingress without
in the least degree molesting the visitors, thus enabling the
admirers of the works of nature to view the whole process of
forming the cells and depositing the honey therein.</p>

<p>Within these few days, Messrs. Neighbour have added to the
Apiary a bee-hive constructed entirely of glass, protected by a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">- 259 -</span>
cover neatly made of straw, but so contrived that on application
to the attendant it can be removed instantly, thus illustrating more
particularly the curious workmanship of these amusing insects.</p>

<p>Her Majesty the Queen and the Prince Consort, with the
Royal Children, were some time engaged in watching with deep
interest the busy scene before them, and putting many questions
relating to the habits and economy of the honey-bee.</p>

<h4>INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION, 1862.</h4>

<p class="tdc"><i>From the "Illustrated London News," August 16, 1862.</i></p>

<p>One of the most interesting and instructive objects in the
Exhibition is a transparent hive, in which the bees may be seen
at full work. Among the collection of bee-hives exhibited by
Messrs. Neighbour and Son, is one of glass, stocked with a colony
of Italian Alp bees. Here the queen-bee may be seen surrounded
by her subjects, which pay the most deferential attention to their
sovereign. Through an aperture cut in the wall, the busy throng
of bees are continually passing and repassing. They go out at
their pleasure into the open court, fly over the annexe into the
grounds of the Horticultural Society and other adjacent gardens,
and return laden with sweets.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>From the "Journal of Horticulture," October 21, 1862.</i></p>

<p>G. Neighbour, and Sons, 149, Regent Street, and 117, Holborn,
No. 2157, have a very handsome and complete stall, on
ascending the steps of which we found a flourishing stock of
Ligurians, apparently not at all ashamed of the public position
which they occupied, and working vigorously in the full light of
day. The queen, one of the largest and finest-coloured we have
met with, was perambulating the combs and receiving the homage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">- 260 -</span>
of her subjects, stopping frequently to deposit an egg in every
empty cell. The hive itself was a "Woodbury Unicomb,"
handsomely got up in mahogany, invented, as its name implies,
by our valued correspondent, "A Devonshire Bee-keeper," the
construction of which will be readily understood by an inspection
of the engraving at <a href="#Page_102">page 102</a>. Its distinctive features are
the adaptation of the movable-bar system to unicomb-hives, by
which any colony in an apiary of "Woodbury hives" can be
placed in the unicomb-hive in a few minutes, and the use of
"outside venetians," or "sun-blinds," as they are called, instead
of the usual impervious shutters. By this contrivance light is
never excluded, so that when the hive is open for inspection, all
its inmates continue their avocations with their accustomed regularity,
and a quiet and orderly scene is presented to the spectator
instead of the hubbub and confusion which ensues in ordinary
unicomb-hives. On the left-hand side of the unicomb hangs a
beautifully-executed drawing of a Ligurian queen-bee magnified,
together with the queen-worker and drone of <i>Apis Ligustica</i>, of
the natural size. Immediately under the drawing is placed a
square glass super, containing nearly forty pounds of the finest
honeycomb. On the right of the unicomb-hive is another super
of the same description, containing nearly thirty pounds of the
purest honey. These supers are, undoubtedly, by far the finest
in the Exhibition, and are the first worked in England by Ligurian
bees, being from the apiary of "A Devonshire Bee-keeper."
In addition to these, the most striking objects, are shown Neighbour's
Improved Single Box and Cottage Hives, Taylor's Bar-Hives,
Woodbury Frame and Bar-hives, the new Bottle-feeder,
and bee apparatus of every description. It will be apparent from
the foregoing, that Messrs. Neighbour's stall is well worth
inspection, although the various novelties it contains appear to
have met with but scant appreciation by the Jury, who merely
awarded to them that "honourable mention" so lavishly accorded
to far less deserving objects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">- 261 -</span></p>

<p class="tdc"><i>From the "Illustrated News of the World" September 6, 1862.</i></p>

<p>One of the most interesting and instructive objects is the honey-bee
at full work in transparent hives. In the International Exhibition,
Class 9, Eastern Annexe, Messrs. Neighbour and
Son of Holborn and Regent Street, exhibit, amongst a collection
of the most approved bee hives and apparatus, a glass hive, stocked
with a colony of Italian Alp bees. The hive is so constructed as
to admit of easily seeing the queen surrounded by the working
bees. Contrary to the long-established notion that the bees work
only in the dark, this hive is completely open to broad daylight.
The bees do not manifest the least dislike to the exposure, and
they are not discomfited when light is occasionally admitted for
inspecting them. It is obvious that a knowledge of this new
feature must tend to a more general acquaintance with the habits
and hidden mysteries of the bee than has hitherto been the case.
The queen may be seen depositing the eggs in the cells; in this
manner she goes on multiplying the species, the working-bees
surrounding her, and paying the most deferential attention, with
their heads always towards her. Not the least interesting part
is to watch the entrance; facility is afforded for doing so, the
sunken way communicating with the hive being covered with
a flat piece of glass. The busy throng pass and repass through
the aperture cut in the wall, so that the bees go out at
their pleasure into the open court, fly over the Annexe into the
Horticultural and other adjacent gardens, and return laden with
crystal sweets gathered from the flowers. The novelty of being
able to inspect living bees, and those of a new variety, as easily
as goods in a shop window, will well repay the trouble of finding
Messrs. Neighbour's stand. These gentlemen will no doubt
cheerfully give any information that may be required.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>From the "Gardener's Weekly Magazine," September 1, 1862,
Conducted by Shirley Hibberd, Esq., F.R.H.S.</i></p>

<p>Neighbour and Son, 149, Regent Street, London (2157).&mdash;This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">- 262 -</span>
is the most important of the exhibitions in this department.
The "bees at work" are in hives open to the inspection of visitors,
the bees passing out through tubes to the open air, and not being
visible within the building, except through the glass of the hives;
The collection of hives of all kinds is complete and interesting, and
we subjoin a figure of the stand (see <a href="#Page_102">page 102</a>) to show how bees
as well as hives may be exhibited conveniently. Amongst the
various contrivances exhibited by Messrs. Neighbour, Nutt's Collateral
Hive has an important place, and though very fancifully
got up, and therefore very attractive to amateur bee-keepers, we
must make the same objection to it as we have above to other
forms of the same from different makers. The Single-box Hive,
the Taylor's Shallow Eight-bar Hive, are the best bee-boxes in
this collection, and every way admirable. Here are no fancy
ventilators which the bees will close up, nor provoking side
boxes which they will hesitate to enter, and from which it will be
hard to dislodge them in order to get them to winter in the
"pavilion." Whoever begins bee-keeping with either of these
will have a fair chance of success. The most popular of the
hives is that called the "Improved Cottage." Its popularity, no
doubt, is due to the compromise between wood and straw which it
accomplishes. People cannot get rid of the idea that a bee-hive
<i>must</i> be made of straw, though it is a material so ill-adapted for
union of swarms, supering, and other operations of advanced bee-culture.
The "Cottager's Hive" is well adapted for "those
apiarians who are desirous of setting up their poorer neighbours
in the way of keeping bees on the improved system." It consists
of stock-hive, small super-hive, and straw cover, and is on the
principle of Payne's, which, has been most successful among
country-people who have got so far as to prefer keeping to killing
their bees. The "Woodbury Bar and Frame Hive" is a
novel construction, combining all the best features of the best bar
boxes, and adding some new ones of great value and importance.
We recommend every bee-keeper to become possessed of this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">- 263 -</span>
admirable contrivance, with which Mr. Woodbury has accomplished
wonderful things in the multiplication of the new race of
Ligurian bees. In general form and proportions it resembles
Taylor's and Tegetmeier's boxes, but in the arrangement of the
bars it is unique. The stock-box is furnished with ten movable
bars and frames, after the German plan. Each bar has a projection
running along the under side; this ridge is chosen by the
bees for the foundation of combs, rendering guide-combs unnecessary.
The supers have glass sides and eight bars, so that the
operator need never be in doubt when to add another box above,
or take away the harvest.</p>

<p>The "Unicomb," or one-comb observatory hive, is intended
solely for purposes of observation, and though furnished with
doors to keep up a uniform degree of heat, Messrs. Neighbour
have found in their experience at the Regent's Park Gardens and
elsewhere, that the bees manifest no dislike to a continual exposure
to light. As this elegant contrivance can be placed in the
window of a drawing-room, it is adapted to the amusement and
instruction of the family circle, as well as to the more serious
objects of the entomologist and scientific apiarian. All that is
necessary is to connect the outlet with the open air by means of a
length of tubing or wooden tunnel, and the bees pass in and out
without obtaining access to the room, and all the mysteries of
the hive are open to daily observation. There are numerous
other hives, bee-feeders, bee-armour, &amp;c., &amp;c., which we have
not space to notice, but which we advise our apiarian friends to
inspect, as the collection of Messrs. Neighbour illustrates fully
every department of this interesting subject.</p>

<h4>BATH AND WEST OF ENGLAND AGRICULTURAL SHOW AT EXETER, IN JUNE, 1863.</h4>

<p class="tdc"><i>From the "Journal of Horticulture" June 23, 1863.</i></p>

<p>A novel feature in the Exhibition of the Bath and West of
England Agricultural Society, which took place at Exeter list
week, was the stall of Messrs. Neighbour and Sons, in which
were exhibited bees at work in glass hives, and apiarian appliances
of every description. There were two Ligurian stocks of
bees at full work, one in a full-sized Woodbury Unicomb Hive,
having been brought from London For the occasion, and the
other a smaller hive of the same description, being from the
neighbouring apiary of our valued correspondent, "A Devonshire
Bee-keeper." Amongst the hives exhibited, the Woodbury
Frame Hive in straw appeared both novel and good, whilst
amongst the apparatus, artificial combs, and the stereotyped
plates for making them, seemed to us the most worthy of attention.</p>

<p>There was a remarkably curious specimen of artificial combs,
or partition wall, partially fabricated into complete comb by the
bees, which struck us as being well worth examination, showing,
as it did, the various stages by which this transformation is
effected, and being calculated to throw light on the problem as
to the mode in which bees construct their combs. It is almost
unnecessary to state that this unique and instructive stall was
crowded throughout the week, and we hope its financial results
were such as will lead Messrs. Neighbour to continue their
attendance at the Society's meetings.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>From the "Western Times" Exeter, June 12, 1863.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">For the Little Busy Bee.</span>&mdash;Next to the poultry tents,
and set back against the yard fencing, is the exhibition of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">- 265 -</span>
Messrs. George Neighbour and Sons, 127, High Holborn, and
149, Regent Street, London, inventors and manufacturers of
improved bee-hives for taking honey without the destruction of
the bees. The savage knows where to find the nest of the wild
bee, and how to get at his honey; but all the improvement upon
the covetousness of the savage made by the long after ages of the
world to modern times, was to find the means of luring the
pattern of industry to a convenient atelier, where he might be
more easily first murdered and then robbed. Their habits early
attracted the attention of some of the best observers of ancient as
well as modern times. Cicero and Pliny tell of the philosopher
Hyliscus quitting human society, and retiring to the desert to contemplate
their peaceful industry. The ancient poet, in his <i>Sic vos
vobis</i>, plaintively sings over bee and beast living, or rather dying,
not for themselves, but the lord of creation, yet was it left to
modern times&mdash;very modern times&mdash;to join the sentiment of
humanity to the rapacity of the barbarian. Mr. Neighbour
has a very complete collection of specimens of the ingenious and
successful contrivances in the construction of hives for the double
object of preserving the honey and the life of the bee, and also
subsidiarily of promoting its comfort during its busy and useful
life. We are not allowed to forget here that we have residing in
our city one of the first apiarians in the kingdom&mdash;Mr. Thomas
Woodbury, of Mount Radford. If the bee-philosophy be his
hobby, we must recollect that all great discoveries and improvements
owe their existence to men who had the power and the will
to concentrate their faculties upon a single object. One proof of
his genius in this his favourite department of action, is seen
among this collection of Mr. Neighbour's, in the "Woodbury
Unicomb Hive." It might be, when closed up, for aught that
appears, a neat case of books; but on opening two doors of the
Venetian blind pattern, back and front, we see between the glass
walls the insect city exposed to view, with all the population in
action. There it may be seen</p>

<p class="p0">Some of the hives are constructed chiefly for the purpose of promoting
a philosophic observation of the bee's habits and methods
of procedure in his wonderful work. "Neighbour's Unicomb
Observatory Hive" is a great novelty, being constructed with
glass slides, the hidden mysteries of the hive being exposed to
the full light of day. "Huber's Book or Leaf Hive" is constructed
to facilitate the object of the scientific apiarian. But the
class of hives which will most interest those desirous of promoting
bee-keeping among the many will be those for the cottage. There
can be no doubt that many a poor cottager in the country, if he
could be made to see the advantage it would be to him, and were
taught the most economical and successful way of managing this
species of "live stock," would add thereby something considerable
to his small earnings in the course of a summer. Members
of Cottage Garden Societies have turned their attention to it very
generally; but to get the thing well afloat, requires in every
district the devotion of some earnest enthusiast who will take up
the apostolic rule of action "This one thing I do." There is
the No. 5 "Improved Cottage Hive," in which three bell
glasses are employed, enabling you to take a glass of the purest
honey from the hive in the most vigorous period of the season.
Then there are other hives of simpler construction and less expensive,
but all illustrative of the sentiment of humanity which seeks
to preserve from wanton destruction those useful and interesting
auxiliaries to our luxury and comfort. This comparatively unimportant
stand, in point of size, cannot but attract the attention
of a large number of visitors, especially of the ladies and the
clergy, who are desirous of promoting the cultivation of the bee
among the poor. To heighten the interest for the curious, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">- 267 -</span>
one of Mr. Woodbury's hives the bees are all alive and at it,
and for those who are disposed to go further into the subject,
information is available touching this fashionable, profitable,
and domesticated member of the apiarian family, the Ligurian
or Italian Alp bee. Our old dark-coated delver is threatened
with supercession, just as the black rat was driven off by the
Norwegian invader, now in possession,&mdash;as the old races of cattle
are being metamorphosed in the sleek, shapely, beef-bearing,
small-boned animals of the present time.</p>

<p class="tdc"><i>From the "Devon Weekly Times" June 12, 1863,</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bees.</span>&mdash;Messrs. Neighbour &amp; Sons, of London, are exhibitors
of two Woodbury Unicomb Hives, showing the royal
and common bees in full work. These hives are very ingeniously
constructed, and were invented by Mr. T. Woodbury, of Mount
Radford. Among other apiarian attractions, we may mention
the improved Cottage and Cottager's Hives, which are well
worthy the notice of those for whom they are designed, and the
Ladies' Observatory Hive. The Messrs. Neighbour also exhibit
Ligurian bees.</p>


<p class="tdc"><i>From "Woolmer's Exeter Gazette" June 12, 1863.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Improved Bee-Hives.</span>&mdash;At a stand near the poultry tents
are exhibited Neighbour's Improved Bee-hives for the taking
of honey without the destruction of bees. The hives are stocked
with the famous Ligurian bee. The Unicomb Observatory
Hive is constructed with glass sides, so that the whole of the
movements of the Apiarian colony are visible, including the proceedings
of the queen and her court. This and some of the
other descriptions of hives manufactured by Messrs. Neighbour
are invented by T. W. Woodbury, Esq. They are furnished
with movable bars, after the German fashion. Each bar has a
projection along the underside; this ridge being waxed, induces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">- 268 -</span>
the bees to build parallel combs, thus obviating the necessity for
a guide-comb. This description of hive is best suited for the
Ligurian or Italian Alp bee. Stocks of this species, now so
much in repute, may be obtained of Messrs. Neighbour, 149,
Regent Street, London.</p>

<h4>ROYAL AGRICULTURAL SHOW, NEWCASTLE, 1864.</h4>

<p class="tdc"><i>From the "Northern Daily Express" July 22 (published at
Newcastle).</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Model Factory.</span>&mdash;Stand 194.&mdash;G. Neighbour and
Sons, Regent Street, and High Holborn, London. We have
heard of model farms and model lodging-houses for the working
classes, but it was reserved for the Royal Agricultural Society's
Meeting in 1864 to introduce to our notice a model factory,
where we may see representatives of the working classes busily
engaged in their daily avocations. The stand which we have
quoted above may afford fruitful study to such philanthropists as
the Earl of Shaftesbury, who make it their benevolent aim to
elevate the masses, and the lesson here given from actual life will
not be lost upon working men themselves. There are several
striking features worthy of notice in the "model factory." We
can clearly perceive that it has been established on a principle
which is essential to the success of any great concern&mdash;namely,
the principle of a good understanding amongst the operatives
themselves, and between them and the head of the establishment.
What strikes us in this model factory is the unity of action which
reigns throughout. There is no jostling of rival interests, and
no misunderstandings or cross purposes. The operatives in this
establishment are so numerous that we question if any one has as
yet been able to count their number, and yet all seem to be
working in perfect harmony, their joint labour continually leading
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">- 269 -</span>
to one beautiful and sublime result. Another feature specially
noticeable in the establishment in question is the principle of
subordination. Singular to say, that while the operatives are
males<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>, the foreman of this model factory is a female; but that
circumstance need not shock the sensibilities of our fair friends
any more than it ought to offend the prejudices of the sterner sex,
inasmuch as the mighty empire of Great Britain is ruled by the
gentle hand of a female; and moreover, in the one case as in the
other, the presiding genius, amid all her official cares and duties,
takes care to preserve the modesty of her sex. She never in the
slightest degree obtrudes herself needlessly on public observation,
and probably on that very account the respect shown to her by
her subjects is the more profound and devoted. There is, however,
one particular in which we would take leave to demur to
the idea of this factory being in every respect regarded as a
"model." We have not been able to discover that there is any
particular period of the day in which the operatives are allowed
to take refreshments. We, in England, have been accustomed
to regard the dinner-hour somewhat in the light of a sacred institution.
And if the Council of the Royal Agricultural Society
mean to set this up as a model institution, we are of opinion that
some explanation on this point is desirable. Indeed, we have not
been able to discover that the operatives in this establishment take
any refreshment whatever. If they do, it must be "on the sly,"
vulgarly speaking. There is one peculiarity, however, which
must tend to popularize this institution, and which has sensed to
make it one of the most attractive objects on the show ground.
It is the fashion in all the great factories which abound on the
banks of the Tyne and throughout the country generally to act
on the principle of exclusiveness to a very great extent, and perhaps
wisely so. As you approach the door you see an intimation
In legible characters, "No admission except on business." This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">- 270 -</span>
may be very proper, but it is rather tantalising. In the model
factory which we are now describing all the operations are open
to inspection. Every action is patent to the eye of the spectator.
This has been effected by a skilful contrivance, and it is this contrivance,
in fact, which has entitled the inventor to obtain a place
in the show ground for his model factory, which he describes by
the somewhat ambiguous term "a new implement." But our
readers may wish to learn what is the staple manufacture of this
wonderful workshop. We reply&mdash;"honey." The factory we
speak of is nothing more nor less than a bee-hive; or, to quote
from the catalogue, "An Unicomb Observatory Bee-hive," with
living Italian Alpine bees at full work; it was invented by T.
W. Woodbury, of Exeter, and is improved and manufactured
by the exhibitors. As implied by its name, this hive has one
comb, so that both sides are fully exposed to the light of day,
thus allowing of an easy inspection of the queen-bee, surrounded
by her retinue.</p>

<h4>BEES AND BEE-HIVES AT THE ROYAL AGRICULTURAL
SOCIETY'S MEETING AT PLYMOUTH.</h4>

<p class="tdc"><i>From the "Journal of Horticulture" August 22, 1865.</i></p>

<p>Living bees at work are always attractive, not only to bee-keepers,
but to the general public. Messrs. Neighbour and Sons'
exhibition formed no exception to this general rule, for their
stand was at all times densely crowded. The chief object of interest
was the Woodbury Unicomb Observatory Hive, in which
was a stock of Ligurian bees, with a very fine queen surrounded
by her yellow Italian subjects. Messrs. Neighbour also exhibited
a square Woodbury glass hive stocked with English bees, in
which the position of the bars and frames, with bees and combs,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">- 271 -</span>
could be very distinctly seen. Both these colonies were brought
from Mr. A. Neighbour's apiary, near London. The bees
obtained egress and ingress by means of a covered way nearly
three feet long, which appeared but little to inconvenience them,
whilst, being covered with glass, it added not a little to the
interest with which they were observed. In the wall of the shed
were small apertures, with alighting-boards fixed on the outside,
and although the public passed in crowds before these unprotected
entrances, no one was stung, nor were the bees themselves
interfered with or molested&mdash;a warning notice appended to the
outside being universally attended to, and a respectful distance
maintained.</p>

<p>Amongst Messrs. Neighbour's collection were the Woodbury
Straw Bar-and-Frame, Neighbour's Improved Cottage, the
Ladies' Observatory, Cottager's, and many low-priced straw
hives on the improved system. The impressed wax sheets, with
specimens of combs partially worked therefrom, were interesting
and curious. The bottle-feeder, bee-dresses, india-rubber gloves,
and other apiarian appliances also received, and were worthy of,
much attention.</p>

<p>By way of illustrating the fruits of the honey-harvest of the
present year, Messrs. Neighbour had a square super of fine white
honeycomb from the apiary of our esteemed correspondent,
Mr. Woodbury, and an octagon glass super from our valued
contributor, Mr. S. Bevan Fox, both of which admirable specimens
were most highly commended.</p>

<p>The Appendix ends on <a href="#Page_271">page 271</a>. However, the Index which begins two
pages afterward start at page 269. Therefore, the Index was renumbered
starting at 273. The item numbers for the Price List at the end of the
book are not in numerical order and there are some repeated numbers. No
attempt was made to correct this. On <a href="#Page_144">page 144</a>, the word "bee-keeper"
in the first line of "ZINC FOUNTAIN BEE-FEEDER" was changed to
"bee-feeder".</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
